An annotation is generated for Java as well, but it doesn't show up in the label.We think it's better for it to not be there, and we know it's possible to hide it, but haven't figured out for sure how that's happening (though we have a guess).",

Our logic is [here](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/blob/master/src/providers/dart_completion_item_provider.ts#L63)).\r\n\r\nI think it's a good idea for us to push updates to clients before the server starts sending these to ensure we don't end up with weird labels in the completion list (and we don't choke on the new type).

Does this mean in theory that changes like this might suddenly end up in flutter users hands? (eg. if Flutter decided to update the SDK in the engine now). If so, there's a risk that we're going to have a lot less time between analyzer changes being made and ending up at users in order to make any required changes to editors (and get them released, and everyone updated)?",

I understand how to fix, I was just concerned about timing - eg. if you push this out before Code users have a fix, I'll get lots of bug reports :-)\r\n\r\nI also need to make another tweak - currently I'm slapping parens on the end of this so it looks like:\r\n\r\n`toString() { ... }()`\r\n\r\nThis is because normally we'll add them to the ends of methods to make it more obvious whether they take args or not (we show `()` or `(…)`). I guess I need to not do that here. Btw, any chance os using a proper ellipsis so it fits in with my suffixes? :D",
