And can use the `Show Context Actions` to fix some problem such as `import some file` quickly. \r\n- But now we had separate all business and then every business is a package. Not only that, There have some plugins in our project. \r\n- Because of that, Now we can't use `Show Context Actions` to import quickly. It is really difficult when developing. \r\n- By the way, The `Main menu/Code/Completion/Basic` is also not work\r\n- It is the `Main menu/Code/Completion/Basic`. It show `No suggestion` when I want auto complete\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15923034/71405082-58b98500-266f-11ea-944a-545b50ef0ab0.png)\r\n\r\n- It is the `Show Context Actions`.
