    "body": "Hello! I've been running into this bug more and more as I work on projects that contain some Flutter directories along-side plain-old-Dart projects or Angular Dart projects.\r\n\r\nUse-case: I have a project with 3 directories:\r\n\r\n  - `app_base`: Pure Dart lib to be shared by an Angular and Flutter app\r\n  - `app_flutter`: Flutter app that relies on app_base\r\n  - `app_angular`: Angular app that relies on app_base\r\n\r\nWhen I try to run tests in `app_base`, I get the following error:\r\n\r\n ```\r\nRunning \"flutter packages get\" in app_base...compiler message: Error: Could not resolve the package 'flutter_test' in 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart'.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich makes sense -- `app_base` shouldn't depend on Flutter! However, it seems like once you set the Flutter SDK for a project, it tries to run all tests as if they were Flutter tests. It would be great if the Flutter plugin either:\r\n\r\n  1. Allowed me to select which directories in my Project are Flutter directories (similar to the Dart plugin)\r\n  2. Understood the current directory is a Dart project, not a Flutter project, and ran good ol' Dart tests in that case\r\n\r\n## Workaround\r\n\r\nCreate a Run config for Pure dart tests. This quickly becomes cumbersome, however -- if I want to run/debug a single test in a single file, I always need to create a new run config rather than allowing the IDE to run an erroneous flutter test\r\n\r\nThanks!",
