If this is all handled inside the Flutter tool (presenting only a single debug session to the IDE) this wouldn't be presented to the user very well (where does it show that you're stopped if two devices are stopped at different locations? what happens when you step?) so it's likely debugging would have to be disabled if it was done that way.\r\n\r\nAnother option would be to have the IDE drive multiple sessions (eg. as if you launched the app multiple times, once on each device). This is what I tried to implement (in VS Code) a while back, but right now concurrent builds/reloads don't work because they overwrite each others build output. Supporting this requires additional work which turned out to be nontrivial (see https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/18566).\r\n\r\nI don't think these issues are insurmountable, but it's unfortunately not as simple as just doing what the console version does.",

Its the hot-reload on save that I'm missing.\r\n\r\nThere are many features that require a connection to the debugger (VM service) - for example the widget inspector. If you're testing multiple layouts on different form factors and you notice an issue, you might wish to use the widget inspector, but without a VM service connection, you'd might need to stop and then re-launch on a single device (since your editor wouldn't have enough information to know which device you want to inspect - they might all be showing different screens). This limitation may be ok to some, but feel really limiting to others.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about the work required for each solution to know whether it's a good trade-off (I mostly only work on the VS Code extensions - and I'm often asked about supporting this there).",

When the \"Run on all devices\" option is selected, it would do the `-d all` for ya instead of having to run each config individually then know this somewhat hidden option is enabled.",
