    "body": "Flutter plugin for IntelliJ is limited in auto importing dart files, currently, if you don't specify the imports manually you can't reference that class in your dart file. IDE auto-suggest doesn't work if the import is missing. \r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n- Create a new Dart class in a flutter project - Foo. \r\n- Open Foo.dart and type Class Foo extends \r\n- Say this is a flutter widget and you want to extend StatelessWidget. If you do Command Space 2 times ideally IDE should start suggesting you. But this doesn't work. \r\n- If you manually import the package, then auto suggest will work. \r\n\r\n## Ideal case\r\n- Since I already have all the dependencies in my pubspec.yaml, IntelliJ should auto suggest everything possible. \r\n- This is the default behavior when you code in java/kotlin. I have never added an import manually while working on android apps. \r\n- Also, manual import is very crude, if you have a package Foo and then a dart file inside it say bar.dart, you can not just type bar.dart and try to autocomplete at importing. IntelliJ will not recognize that there is a bar.dart in foo package. You need to first autocomplete foo and then it will suggest you other files inside it. It is just like a command line model where you need to know the absolute path for doing anything. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Version info\r\n\r\n[✓] Flutter (Channel beta, v0.11.8, on Mac OS X 10.13.6 17G65, locale en-US)\r\n    • Flutter version 0.11.8 at /Users/pairan/flutter\r\n    • Framework revision f5b02e3c05 (27 hours ago), 2018-11-20 07:49:29 -0800\r\n    • Engine revision 1baf081343\r\n    • Dart version 2.1.0 (build 2.1.0-dev.9.4 f9ebf21297)\r\n\r\n[✓] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK 28.0.3)\r\n    • Android SDK at /Users/pairan/Library/Android/sdk\r\n    • Android NDK location not configured (optional; useful for native profiling support)\r\n    • Platform android-28, build-tools 28.0.3\r\n    • ANDROID_HOME = /Users/pairan/Library/Android/sdk\r\n    • Java binary at: /Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jre/jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_152-release-1136-b06)\r\n    • All Android licenses accepted.\r\n\r\n[✓] iOS toolchain - develop for iOS devices (Xcode 10.1)\r\n    • Xcode at /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer\r\n    • Xcode 10.1, Build version 10B61\r\n    • ios-deploy 1.9.4\r\n    • CocoaPods version 1.5.2\r\n\r\n[✓] Android Studio\r\n    • Android Studio at /Applications/Android Studio 3.2 Preview.app/Contents\r\n    ✗ Flutter plugin not installed; this adds Flutter specific functionality.\r\n    ✗ Dart plugin not installed; this adds Dart specific functionality.\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_152-release-1136-b04)\r\n\r\n[✓] Android Studio (version 3.2)\r\n    • Android Studio at /Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents\r\n    • Flutter plugin version 30.0.1\r\n    • Dart plugin version 181.5656\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_152-release-1136-b06)\r\n\r\n[✓] IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition (version 2018.2.6)\r\n    • IntelliJ at /Users/pairan/Applications/JetBrains Toolbox/IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate.app\r\n    • Flutter plugin version 27.1.3\r\n    • Dart plugin version 182.4129.13\r\n\r\n[✓] VS Code (version 1.29.0)\r\n    • VS Code at /Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents\r\n    • Flutter extension version 2.20.0\r\n\r\n[✓] Connected device (1 available)\r\n    • Android SDK built for x86 • emulator-5554 • android-x86 • Android 7.0 (API 24) (emulator)",
