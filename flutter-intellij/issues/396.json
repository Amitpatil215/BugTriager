We may need to re-think the CLI modes\nand how we expose them in the CLI and IDE.  We could for example never\nbuild \"release\" from the IDE but only --debug and --profile so that we\nalways have observatory control.  And then have a separate \"build an\ninstall release\" command in the menus somewhere\".  We also could consider\nsplitting out the command line's run into separate \"debug\", \"profile\"\ncommands.  I guess what I'm saying is we can do a lot of different things\nhere if someone has a concrete/coherent proposal.\n\nHow changeable is IntelliJ's pattern here?  As luke suggests, having a\nseparate debug/run button is kinda dated to me.  Or certainly having your\ndefault button imply \"debug\" seems that way to me.  What does AppCode or\nAndroidStudio do?

No difference in the executed app. The same about Run with Coverage or any other Run (yes, you can add other Run actions by implementing corresponding extension point, but not sure you need) - the app that is executed is the same regardless of the button that you press. I admit that there might be exceptions to the rule but they should be thought over carefully.\n> Run/debug modes are usually configured at Run Configuration level.\n\nSo yes, you can add more buttons. But as for now all runners (i.e. all buttons) are not framework specific. Each button (Run/Debug/Coverage) can start different types of apps. If your plugin is going to contribute another button - it will always be visible in all non-flutter projects as well (as disabled).\nMay be AppCode and Android Studio have specific runners, but they are technology-targeted IDEs.\n",
