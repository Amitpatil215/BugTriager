I believe the only required fields are the config name (`Unnamed` in this example) and the path to the file. And I'm not even sure the file is absolutely required, since it doesn't appear anywhere in the `app.start` command.\n\nIf we allow one project to contain several Flutter apps then we'd have to specify the CWD for the app in the launch config. Not sure if that is supported.\n\nIf you're thinking we should put something appropriate into the `Name` field then perhaps we could extract the app name from `flutter.yaml` and disambiguate with a numeric suffix.\n\nThe `app.start` command has `route` and `target` parameters that we are not using. Should fields be added to the form for them? (I admit to not knowing their purpose.)\n\nDo you think Flutter devs will have several launch configs for each app? Might be worth checking with UX researchers.\n",
