Off the top of my head, here's what I think we could use in order of usefulness:\r\n\r\n1. view the URL, HTTP headers, and body of requests and responses\r\n2. filtering requests by type (XHR, image) and by filter text\r\n3. \"preserve log\" feature across app restarts (maybe this is useful for logging more generally?)\r\n4. copy the request as cURL\r\n5. timing of all requests the app has made\r\n6. redo a request\r\n\r\nMore generally, yes, we use the logging package mentioned above, and being able to filter, color-code, etc would come in handy. \r\n\r\nWhat other solutions have people found for IntelliJ? Would there be a way to make the logging package compatible with an off-the-shelf IntelliJ plugin... perhaps writing to a .log file and opening with [ideolog](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9746-ideolog)?",

In our project create a folder name `tmp`\r\n2. Open terminal.\r\n3. `cd` to the `tmp` folder.\r\n4. run a command \r\n```\r\n(rm flutter.log; flutter logs >> flutter.log)\r\n```\r\n5.

Interop w/ the grep plugin is a little to the side of what I'm working on at the moment.  The current approach is a drop-in replacement, using among other things a tree table rather than a text view but making the standard console work with it shouldn't be too hard.  I haven't looked but I'm a little surprised that it doesn't \"just work\".  Anyway, if that's high on your list, would you consider opening a fresh issue to track?  Thanks @the4thfloor!",

I've generally used the `logging` package in the past (for flutter_redux), not the `logger` package! :P\r\n\r\n**Reloads / Restarts**\r\n\r\nJust my two cents:\r\n\r\nOn Reload: I like the idea of a line, maybe with a timestamp or some way to uniquely identify that reload. That way if you add or remove print statements for example, you can clearly see where they start / stop. If you navigate between reloads, you'd have some idea of which one you're looking at by evaluating the timestamp.\r\n\r\nOn Restart: Not sure if I'd want a line or if I'd prefer to completely clear (aka \"restart\") the console. If it's not too onerous, an option would be nice to have so we could try both options. I do see restarts as: \"Ok, let's start fresh here.\"\r\n\r\n**Network Inspection**\r\n\r\nPerhaps related to logging, but maybe separate, but I definitely agree with @johnpryan's points above. The `flutter_stetho` plugin I built to inspect network requests is limited to Android, and takes you out of your normal dev flow a bit by needing to use Chrome to inspect the traffic. It would be amazing if you could inspect this type of traffic within the IDE (that also might be a rather large chunk of work :P).\r\n\r\n**Logging Color Customizations**\r\n\r\nI could see it working similar to the ADB Logcat configuration (screenshot below).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this new work is tied to the logging package, but if such an interface existed, it might make more sense to conform to the levels offered by the *logging* package instead of the android standard: https://pub.dartlang.org/documentation/logging/latest/logging/Level-class.html \r\n\r\n<img width=\"1284\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-06-09 at 5 14 59 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/126604/41193129-a7572e6a-6c08-11e8-9ebc-5ca166b6c70e.png\">\r\n",

It would be great to know what we could do to line this view up with your imagined use cases. What does the simple text view allow you to do that this view doesn't? Thanks in advance!\r\n\r\nI mean for now the console give me: \r\ntimestamp, info, flutter.tools, [11:11:11 FINE CartRepository] my custom log...\r\nBut what I really want is: \r\ntimestamp, fine, CartRepository, my custom log...\r\n\r\nSo maybe I'm not using `package:logging ` like I should... but from what I understand it should be the case right ? That why I'm saying that the text console is better because with this one it doesn't offer me anything more... is there something special to do with the logger ? ",
