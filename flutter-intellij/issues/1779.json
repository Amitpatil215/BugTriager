Particularly pertinent when trying to set a breakpoint within a lambda.\r\n>sometimes I hover over a local and it just doesn't show the tooltip for an expression. I can often point at a different local that contains that local and go from there, but it's frustrating.\r\nbreakpoints in tests I simply cannot get to work. I'm not sure, but it may be due to me using community IntelliJ.\r\n>Other than that, pretty happy with the experience.",

The encoding (`%5C`), the alignment. It's all just a bit ... _ugh_\r\n* The thing I tend to care about most (expected versus actual) is right at the _bottom_ of the stack trace, so I have to scroll right to the end to see it.\r\n\r\nOther problems with the test runner:\r\n\r\n* Why not auto-select the first failed test?\r\n* It seems to randomly decide to keep certain nodes collapsed/expanded and I have no idea why. It would be nice if it just remembered which nodes I have collapsed and which are expanded, from one test run to the next.\r\n* I still haven't figured out how to create a test configuration that will just run all my tests, which are in separate files (one per feature). Instead, I have to create one test configuration per file.",
