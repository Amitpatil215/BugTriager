I had a project I was working on, with path set to the stable path. `C:\\Flutter\\SDK`\r\n2. at some point in time after that, I cloned the flutter repo and set it, and changed the path to it - so it was `C:\\development\\flutter`\r\n3. some time after that, I cloned a new project and opened it. The path was then set to the flutter one `C:\\development\\flutter`\r\n\r\nWhen cloning new projects and loading them for the time, the path seems to be the correct one - `C:\\Flutter\\SDK`\r\n\r\nI also added few env variables such as `FLUTTER_ROOT` though, which wasn't set before - not sure if that changed anything or not.\r\n\r\nSince it's now working from me we can close this issue, although it would be nice to know which env variables affect the path and which don't.",
