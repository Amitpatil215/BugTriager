Reassign the `Flutter SDK path`: \r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/chInLbR.png)\r\n\r\n   1. Enable Dart support for the project: \r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/vldv3oZ.png)\r\n\r\n   1. Sync project with Gradle Files.\r\n\r\nBefore that, the project view looks like this: \r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zth0M6h.png)\r\nThat means that I am unable to access any project directories (`android`, `ios` or `lib`) because the Flutter plugin is not connected properly (until I fix it with the necessary steps described above).  \r\nThis also disables all code analysis and completion features (if I open a file externally because I cannot access it from inside the workspace before enabling support and syncing) & the ability to run the application from within Android Studio.\r\n\r\n### I have tried\r\n\r\nReinstalling from [the Android Studio Preview website](https://developer.android.com/studio/preview/) and `flutter upgrade`..\r\n\r\n### Doctor\r\n\r\n```\r\nflutter doctor -v\r\n[√] Flutter (Channel master, v0.8.3-pre.28, on Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0], locale en-US)\r\n    • Flutter version 0.8.3-pre.28 at flutterRoot\r\n    • Framework revision 0e8103ff13 (4 hours ago), 2018-09-11 18:16:21 +0200\r\n    • Engine revision 9a173a8dc8\r\n    • Dart version 2.1.0-dev.4.0.flutter-ef72098353\r\n\r\n[!] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK 28.0.2)\r\n    • Android SDK at sdkRoot\r\n    • Android NDK location not configured (optional; useful for native profiling support)\r\n    • Platform android-28, build-tools 28.0.2\r\n    • Java binary at: javaRoot\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_152-release-1136-b06)\r\n    X Android license status unknown.\r\n\r\n[√] Android Studio (version 3.2)\r\n    • Android Studio at studioRoot\r\n    X Flutter plugin not installed; this adds Flutter specific functionality.\r\n    X Dart plugin not installed; this adds Dart specific functionality.\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_152-release-1136-b06)\r\n```\n\n",

Before, when I did not need to fix my project every time I open it, there was no Flutter directory (with my project name) that I needed to unfold to see the actual folders (like `lib`) of my project.  \r\nI believe that before, when I opened the project (which has not moved in its path), it was a Flutter project as a whole, but now it seems like Android Studio thinks that the super project \"contains\" my Flutter project, which is strange, but I cannot seem to fix it.  \r\nI am unsure which files would cause a reset. I e.g. deleted the `.idea` folder and other shenanigans like reinstalling Android Studio as mentioned.",
