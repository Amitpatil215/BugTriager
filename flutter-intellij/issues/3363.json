Now, when I try to use the `sample.dart` file in my `main.dart` and use auto-import feature to import the file, the file is imported in the following way:\r\n```dart\r\nimport 'package:flutter_app/my_pkg/sample.dart';\r\n```\r\n4. The import works fine but it's not following the Usage Guidelines for the Dart language.\r\n5. It should be imported as:\r\n```dart\r\nimport 'my_pkg/sample.dart';\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What went wrong?\r\nThe Flutter Plugin isn't following the guidelines of dart language regarding imports.\r\n\r\nYou can take a look at the guideline regarding imports within the `lib` package:\r\n[Prefer relative paths when importing libraries within your own packages lib directory](https://www.dartlang.org/guides/language/effective-dart/usage#prefer-relative-paths-when-importing-libraries-within-your-own-packages-lib-directory)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Version info\r\n\r\nFlutter Version:  1.2.1\r\nFlutter Plugin Version: 34.0.1\r\n",
