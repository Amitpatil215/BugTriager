But not this option has disappeared completely and I am not able to find any instructions on the web on how to bring it back. I am not sure if this is a bug or lack of documentation.\r\n\r\nAlso, when I was able to run tests with coverage in the past, I was getting coverage info displayed next to each folder and each file, but it always showed 0 coverage. Again, not sure if a bug, but unable to find any more information on the intended behaviour or how to re-produce it.\r\n\r\nNOTE: flutter doctor states that Flutter and Dart plugins are not installed, however it's not correct as both are installed and I believe this is some kind of Android Studio bug\r\n\r\n## Version info\r\n\r\n[√] Flutter (Channel stable, 1.22.4, on Microsoft Windows [Version 6.1.7601], locale en-CA)\r\n    • Flutter version 1.22.4 at C:\\flutter\r\n    • Framework revision 1aafb3a8b9 (4 weeks ago), 2020-11-13 09:59:28 -0800\r\n    • Engine revision 2c956a31c0\r\n    • Dart version 2.10.4\r\n\r\n[√] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 30.0.0)\r\n    • Android SDK at C:\\Users\\Yuliya\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\sdk\r\n    • Platform android-30, build-tools 30.0.0\r\n    • Java binary at: C:\\Program Files\\Android\\Android Studio\\jre\\bin\\java\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_242-release-1644-b01)\r\n    • All Android licenses accepted.\r\n\r\n[!] Android Studio (version 4.1.0)\r\n    • Android Studio at C:\\Program Files\\Android\\Android Studio\r\n    X Flutter plugin not installed; this adds Flutter specific functionality.\r\n    X Dart plugin not installed; this adds Dart specific functionality.\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_242-release-1644-b01)\r\n\r\n[√] VS Code\r\n    • VS Code at C:\\Users\\Yuliya\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Microsoft VS Code\r\n    • Flutter extension version 3.12.0\r\n\r\n[√] Connected device (1 available)\r\n    • TA 1004 (mobile) • NB1GAD1832601470 • android-arm64 • Android 9 (API 28)\r\n\r\n!
