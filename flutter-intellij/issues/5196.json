Why is this different from `flutter build apk --release`?\r\n\r\n@darek607 said:\r\n******************\r\nAccording to the [official guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/android) (_How do I build a release from within Android Studio?_), we can also build release apk from within Android Studio.  However, these builds (I tested release builds) are missing x86_64 so files as opposed to `flutter build apk --release` which generates ABIs correctly for all 3 architectures.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n1. Create a sample Flutter application with Android Studio (File -> New -> new Flutter Project -> Flutter Application)\r\n2. Open the \"android\" folder for editing in Android Studio (I'm using Tools -> Flutter -> Open for Editing in Android Studio option).\r\n3. Build a release APK either by \"Generate Signed Bundle / APK\" **or** by choosing the release build variant and Build -> Make project **or** by executing `assembleRelease` task.\r\n\r\n**Expected results:** \r\nI expect the generated apk contains all 3 supported ABIs: `arm64-v8a`,` armeabi-v7a,` `x86_64` because these architectures are default according to Flutter docs.\r\n\r\n**Actual results:**\r\nThe resulting APK file does not contain `x86_64` ABIs. I tested it by unzipping the APK.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Logs</summary>\r\n\r\n- flutter analyze (no issues)\r\n\r\n- flutter doctor -v\r\n<!-- Finally, paste the output of running `flutter doctor -v` here. -->\r\n\r\n```\r\n[✓] Flutter (Channel stable, 1.20.4, on Mac OS X 10.15.7 19H2, locale pl-PL)\r\n    • Flutter version 1.20.4 at /Users/darek/flutter\r\n    • Framework revision fba99f6cf9 (2 weeks ago), 2020-09-14 15:32:52 -0700\r\n    • Engine revision d1bc06f032\r\n    • Dart version 2.9.2\r\n\r\n \r\n[✓] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 30.0.2)\r\n    • Android SDK at /Users/darek/Library/Android/sdk\r\n    • Platform android-30, build-tools 30.0.2\r\n    • Java binary at: /Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jre/jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_242-release-1644-b3-6222593)\r\n    • All Android licenses accepted.\r\n\r\n[✓] Xcode - develop for iOS and macOS (Xcode 12.0.1)\r\n    • Xcode at /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer\r\n    • Xcode 12.0.1, Build version 12A7300\r\n    • CocoaPods version 1.9.3\r\n\r\n[✓] Android Studio (version 4.0)\r\n    • Android Studio at /Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents\r\n    • Flutter plugin version 49.0.2\r\n    • Dart plugin version 193.7547\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_242-release-1644-b3-6222593)\r\n\r\n[!] Connected device\r\n    !
