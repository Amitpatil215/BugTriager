When I did that instead of Plugin chooses the same **Code Signing Certificate** of XCode it picks one that is not correct.\r\n\r\nI thought It was a problem on Flutter framework, but after I execute the command `flutter run` It asked me to choose **Code Signing Certificate** because I have more than one on my Macbook.\r\n\r\nThis error made me think that the command `flutter config --clear-ios-signing-cert` does not work correctly because even after executing  and performing `flutter run` by Android Studio nothing changed.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n- Have more than one Team ID.\r\n- Have more than on Code Signing Certificate (one for each Team ID).\r\n- Start a project with one Team ID and Code Signing Certificate.\r\n- Perform at least one build on real ios devices using Android Studio.\r\n- Open XCode, change Team ID, Bundle ID and Signing Certificate.\r\n- Try to perform new build on real ios devices using Android Studio.\r\n\r\nEven after performing these steps if the error does not appear, if Android Studio does expose the options to choose one **Signing Certificate** it is an error.\r\n\r\n## Version info\r\n\r\n[✓] Flutter (Channel stable, v1.17.3, on Mac OS X 10.15.5 19F101, locale pt-BR)\r\n    • Flutter version 1.17.3 at /Users/joselucas/developement/flutter\r\n    • Framework revision b041144f83 (3 weeks ago), 2020-06-04 09:26:11 -0700\r\n    • Engine revision ee76268252\r\n    • Dart version 2.8.4\r\n\r\n \r\n[✓] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 29.0.2)\r\n    • Android SDK at /Users/joselucas/Library/Android/sdk\r\n    • Platform android-29, build-tools 29.0.2\r\n    • Java binary at: /Applications/Android\r\n      Studio.app/Contents/jre/jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build\r\n      1.8.0_212-release-1586-b4-5784211)\r\n    • All Android licenses accepted.\r\n\r\n[✓] Xcode - develop for iOS and macOS (Xcode 11.5)\r\n    • Xcode at /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer\r\n    • Xcode 11.5, Build version 11E608c\r\n    • CocoaPods version 1.8.4\r\n\r\n[✓] Android Studio (version 3.6)\r\n    • Android Studio at /Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents\r\n    • Flutter plugin version 46.0.1\r\n    • Dart plugin version 192.8052\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build\r\n      1.8.0_212-release-1586-b4-5784211)\r\n\r\n[!] VS Code (version 1.46.0)\r\n    • VS Code at /Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents\r\n    ✗ Flutter extension not installed; install from\r\n      https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.flutter\r\n\r\n[✓] Connected device (1 available)\r\n    • iPhone • aef8415dfc5a333332fca33b99f8e101d9d32849 • ios • iOS 13.5.1\r\n\r\n!
