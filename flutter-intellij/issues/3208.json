            "body": "We wouldn't consider either of those requests to be \"small\". The engineering effort is rather large, anyway. We've actually made some progress toward eliminating the need to open a new project to edit Android code. In the Flutter plugin preferences there is an experimental option to enable indexing of Java/Kotlin. Unfortunately, it is broken in version 33.0 of the plugin but will be fixed in 33.1, coming out in a couple days. Integration with AppCode is a much harder problem. You'd have to take that up with Jetbrains, since it isn't an open source project.",
