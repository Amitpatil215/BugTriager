The building task will fail with the following output:\r\n\r\n```\r\nRunning Gradle task 'assembleRelease'...                        \r\nError: Unable to write snapshot file\r\n\r\nDart snapshot generator failed with exit code 255\r\nError: Unable to write snapshot file\r\n\r\nDart snapshot generator failed with exit code 255\r\nError: Unable to write snapshot file\r\n\r\nDart snapshot generator failed with exit code 255\r\n\r\n\r\nFAILURE: Build failed with an exception.\r\n\r\n* Where:\r\nScript 'C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Roaming\\Flutter\\packages\\flutter_tools\\gradle\\flutter.gradle' line: 1052\r\n\r\n* What went wrong:\r\nExecution failed for task ':app:compileFlutterBuildRelease'.\r\n> Process 'command 'C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Roaming\\Flutter\\bin\\flutter.bat'' finished with non-zero exit value 1\r\n\r\n* Try:\r\nRun with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace.

What I notice is that after failing, the menu option to build the APK (_Build > Flutter_) is no longer there. I only see a _Recompile_ menu item which is greyed out so I have to restart the IDE before building again.\r\n\r\n## Version info\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Flutter (Channel dev, 2.4.0-4.0.pre, on Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.19042.1052], locale ro-RO)\r\n    â€¢ Flutter version 2.4.0-4.0.pre at C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Roaming\\Flutter\r\n    â€¢ Upstream repository https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git\r\n    â€¢ Framework revision cc00e7e6bc (3 weeks ago), 2021-07-11 18:21:02 -0400\r\n    â€¢ Engine revision ed25e8f01e\r\n    â€¢ Dart version 2.14.0 (build 2.14.0-301.0.dev)\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 30.0.3)\r\n    â€¢ Android SDK at C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\sdk\r\n    â€¢ Platform android-S, build-tools 30.0.3\r\n    â€¢ Java binary at: C:\\Program Files\\Android\\Android Studio\\jre\\bin\\java\r\n    â€¢ Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.10+0-b96-7249189)\r\n    â€¢ All Android licenses accepted.\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Chrome - develop for the web\r\n    â€¢ Chrome at C:\\Program Files\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Visual Studio - develop for Windows (Visual Studio Community 2019 16.9.4)\r\n    â€¢ Visual Studio at C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\Community\r\n    â€¢ Visual Studio Community 2019 version 16.9.31205.134\r\n    â€¢ Windows 10 SDK version 10.0.19041.0\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Android Studio (version 4.2.0)\r\n    â€¢ Android Studio at C:\\Program Files\\Android\\Android Studio\r\n    â€¢ Flutter plugin can be installed from:\r\n      ðŸ”¨ https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9212-flutter\r\n    â€¢ Dart plugin can be installed from:\r\n      ðŸ”¨ https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6351-dart\r\n    â€¢ Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.10+0-b96-7249189)\r\n\r\n[âœ“] VS Code (version 1.58.2)\r\n    â€¢ VS Code at C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Microsoft VS Code\r\n    â€¢ Flutter extension can be installed from:\r\n      ðŸ”¨ https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.flutter\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Connected device (5 available)\r\n    â€¢ Windows (desktop)       â€¢ windows            â€¢ windows-x64     â€¢ Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.19042.1052]\r\n    â€¢ Windows (UWP) (desktop) â€¢ winuwp             â€¢ windows-uwp-x64 â€¢\r\n    â€¢ Chrome (web)            â€¢ chrome             â€¢ web-javascript  â€¢ Google Chrome 92.0.4515.107\r\n    â€¢ Edge (web)              â€¢ edge               â€¢ web-javascript  â€¢ Microsoft Edge 92.0.902.62\r\n",
