You might try looking for rogue java processes that have dart in the name: `ps xa | grep [Dd]art`\r\nKill them and restart the analysis server in IntelliJ. To be more sure, shut down IJ, kill the processes, and restart IJ. If you're still having trouble after that, and everything else works, then maybe something changed in your keymap.\r\n\r\nYou can check that by adding \"Show Intention Actions\" to an existing menu. I added it to Help, just to see if it works. After adding it, select the name of some widget and choose that item from the menu. If the server is working you'll see the normal widget-editing fixes, and that suggests your keymap for alt-enter is not working.",

I'd place the example program in a separate project if it needed to be totally separate. The Flutter `plugin` template does create an example project as a subdir of the Flutter plugin project, but it uses the analysis options of the main plugin. By adding the `example/**` exclude you are telling the analyzer to ignore your example. If you want it to have separate options it will need to be in a different project.\r\n\r\nIf you think every directory that has a pubspec should also allow analysis options then you should discuss that with the Dart SDK engineers: https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues",
