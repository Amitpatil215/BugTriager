I'm guessing that when a diagnostic is selected that server is asked for the fixes in the same way that it's asked for fixes when the cursor is on the line containing the highlight region for the diagnostic. If so, the view has most of the information needed to support the request.\r\n\r\nI say \"most\" because there's a twist. For a given diagnostic there will sometimes be multiple possible kinds of fixes. In those cases we would probably not want to offer to apply a fix for it without requiring the user to specify which fix to apply. Even when there's only one kind of fix, there can be multiple \"fixes\" because we'll also offer to ignore the error, either in one place or for the whole file. And if the same kind of diagnostic is reported at multiple locations within the file, there will also be a fix-all-in-file option. Knowing which of multiple options to choose for the user might be error prone. (It might not be as bad as I expect, though.)\r\n\r\nEven if we ignore the question of deciding which fix to apply, the view would need to apply the fix for one diagnostic, allow server to re-analyze the world, map the new set of diagnostics back to the old list to determine which diagnostics are still being reported, and then apply the fix for the next diagnostic. That would be required because the edits for two separate fixes are not guaranteed to be able to be applied together. Attempting to apply all the edits in a single pass could easily corrupt the user's code. (For example, if an undefined name is referenced in multiple locations, adding an import would fix it everywhere, but if you applied the fix multiple times you'd get multiple identical imports added.)\r\n\r\nThis is all kind of ugly because the plugin doesn't have the full context that the server has. Which suggests that, if we decide to support this request, we should consider adding a protocol to the server to compute a single change for an explicit list of diagnostics. That would take a bit of work, but probably not as much as trying to implement the same support in the plugin.\r\n\r\nWe do have a somewhat similar tool today: `dart fix` will fix all of the diagnostics we know how to fix across an entire directory. What's being requested in something half-way between the fix-a-single-diagnostic and the fix-everything-in-this-directory support that we already have.",

Regarding the two complications you mentioned, I would think we should ignore any selected problems that require making a choice, but also choose to apply the fix rather than ignore it, since the user gave us that instruction, but I could see a counter-argument, too. I can't transfer issues to dart-lang/sdk anymore, so maybe I'll add an issue there.
