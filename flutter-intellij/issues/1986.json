The a stateful widget, this often doesn't quite match the selected class, which will often be something like `_MyWidgetState`. My suggestion is to change the title to be just the class or the class context; so, either `MyStatelessWidget`, or `MyWidget : _MyWidgetState`. That will help the user map the preview area more directly back to the code.\r\n\r\nMy other bit of feedback is that the padding on the toolbar area doesn't match the padding in the `Flutter Outline` toolbar text above it; this should have the same or similar layout.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"136\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-03-22 at 7 39 52 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1269969/37808868-eaf63112-2e09-11e8-9c31-482876cae6b2.png\">\r\n\r\n",

Some subtle indication of work here would be good. Perhaps making the `Preview` title text italic? Adding a small 'live' dot indicator somewhere? (`ExecutionUtil.getLiveIndicator()`)\r\n",
