The SDK isn't anything special, it's the one downloaded by the Flutter tool.\r\n\r\nAbout the only thing I can think of is that I do have my cache directory symlinked (so `bin/cache` is a symlink to `bin/cache.master` in that same directory).  This is so I can avoid downloading another Gig of data each time I switch to stable/dev and back to master.\r\n\r\nI was going to try quitting IntelliJ, switching to a non-symlinked cache dir, and starting again, but I simply restarted (without invalidating the IntelliJ cache, or changing the symlink), and the problem went away: the Flutter plugin now shows the right SDK setting.\r\n\r\nSo, it's possible that having my Flutter cache dir symlinked could cause some issues, but I don't think I moved the symlink around while IntelliJ was running, and it should follow links, right?",
