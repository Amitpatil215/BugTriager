Flutter also has iOS, web, MacOS, Linux, and Windows.\r\n\r\nWe tried to hide it but couldn't find a way to do so. IIRC a project that does not have an Android module does hide it, but then you cannot use some Android tools, like the Device Manager. If anyone knows how to hide it I would be glad to review a PR. :)\r\n\r\nWhen we created the device selector we didn't think about auto-launching an emulator. At that time, Android Studio 3.0 beta did not have a device selector. They did a better job with theirs and we have not had time to go back and catch up.\r\n\r\nThe embedded emulator probably has a better chance of getting implemented than auto-launch. We'll consider it in a future planning session. We'd probably need more up-votes, though, so click that thumbs-up in the OP.\r\n\r\nTechnically, #5910 is a dup of this issue. Usually we keep the oldest issue open, but this one is asking for more work to be done (and probably should be split into two issues, but let's not bother).",

That tree defines a module that contains all the Android Studio specific code, and that module is only loaded when the IDE is Android Studio (i.e. not IntelliJ).\r\n\r\nIf you create an IntelliJ Platform Plugin SDK based on Android Studio (instead of IntelliJ) then it will have all the Android Studio modules available. It wouldn't have source code, though. I have unable to build a source-based Android Studio IDE since Kotlin 1.6 came out. (https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KTIJ-22141/Kotlin-internal-error-during-IR-lowering) You'd need to load `flutter-studio` as a Gradle module into the project. I think everything is set up to do that already, since that's how I've been working for months. You'd probably also need to add dependencies in the Gradle build script to make more Android modules visible to the `flutter-studio` module.\r\n\r\nLet me know if that helps. We might be able to do a Flutter option but it would need to be visible only when Android Studio was in use.",
