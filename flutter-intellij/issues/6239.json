(And I think I actually did get the syntax right in the previous sentence; \"quick fixes\" is a single service.)\r\n\r\n@gspencergoog Auto-select could be done, I suppose, but I worry people would be confused at having multiple selections added automatically. (I think IntelliJ supports multiple selections, but I have never used it.) However, that would be a feature implemented by the Dart plugin. And, switching back to analyzer modifications, I suspect you'd have an up-hill battle to not generate the `throw` because it would likely introduce analysis errors.",
