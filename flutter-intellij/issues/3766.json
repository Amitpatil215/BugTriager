The fix should be to get info for only the leaf nodes.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we look at TestCallExpressions, for example:\r\n\r\n```dart\r\ntest('foo test', () {\r\n  // All the contents of the test.\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nIdeally, we should only look at the leaf elements, such as the method name:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  test\r\n```\r\n\r\nChanging to support this will be difficult because we'll need to look at two leaves on the tree: the test call and the test name.  It's also necessary to do this without breaking support for right clicking inside of a test file.",
