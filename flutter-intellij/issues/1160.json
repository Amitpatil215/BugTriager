    "body": "Hello! I was excited to use the new Android Emulator dropdown, but when I first tried it, it didn't work...\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n  1. Download the latest version of the plugin with IntelliJ CE & restart\r\n  2. Oh no! No android emulators show up\r\n  3. Dig through PRs and find this reference to `ANDROID_HOME`: https://github.com/flutter/flutter-intellij/pull/1140/files#diff-ea5ca6788a3794828791e5cb1ef0af2fR203\r\n  4. Realize I'm on a new machine where that isn't configured \r\n  5. Set it in my `.zshrc` and restart IntelliJ\r\n  6. Profit! (Aka Emulators show up)\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nSo, the problem was that I didn't quite have my `ANDROID_HOME` set, but all I saw as a user was a silent failure. Once I configured it, everything ran smoothly.",
