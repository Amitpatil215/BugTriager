That's painful. Sometimes I don't even notice there is an await in the middle of the line, and when I try to go the the next line it goes somewhere else and don't even know where I was anymore. I have to restart and pay double attention, which wastes my brain CPU and makes it harder for me to reason about the code.\r\n\r\nI was told by Simon Binder that the Dart VM protocol has a \"step to the next line in an async function\" command (and that is accessible from the observatory), but somehow all IDEs don't use that. \r\n\r\nPlease add this to the debugger.\r\n",

I get odd results, though. Note the newline before the call to `foo()`. If it is there then everything works as expected when I put a breakpoint on the line that calls `foo()`. If I delete the newline before `foo()` (and move the breakpoint to the variable declaration) then the debugger steps into `foo` even when I tell it to step over. So, the newline is significant to something.\r\n\r\nWhen I try this with Flutter, the results are even odder. I generated a sample Flutter project, added the two async functions, and added a call to `simple()` in the call to `setState()`, just before `_counter++;`. If I run it as formatted above I get the same results as with the Dart project. If I remove the newline before `foo()` it gets crazy. Step-over causes it to exit `simple()` and be ready to increment the counter. The next step-over does increment it.\r\n\r\n@DanTup could you try this code in a Flutter project, just to confirm this is not a VM problem? The events I'm getting don't have `atAsyncSuspension` set unless the newline is present, or if I've already done step-over once (which is why it exits `simple()`, I believe).",
