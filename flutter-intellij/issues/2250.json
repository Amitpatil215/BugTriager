It doesn't support all the Flutter functionality (since we don't have a `flutter run --machine` instance to talk to - I've opened https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/905 to figure out what's missing and how we can fix that) but @mit-mit thinks IntelliJ might also not have this so there should be an issue open for it (I can't see an existing one).",
