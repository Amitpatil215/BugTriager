The logic Flutter uses is checking which channel it's on, though it feels a bit clunky for the editor to start checking that.\r\n\r\nMaybe we could make a `flutter create --list` so that IDEs can get the same JSON that matches what `flutter create` supports? It can just fetch the JSON and spit it out, but use the same internal logic for checking the hostname to avoid it leaking out?",

If you mean the line numbers etc., they'd still potentially be wrong, because they come from the web, not from the local SDK.

We're not fetching the right data because we didn't duplicate the logic for the hostname, so if you're on `master` there's a mismatch.\r\n\r\nMoving to something like `flutter create --list` makes the fact that it goes to the server an implementation detail that the editors no longer care about (at least, when talking to a new SDK that supports it) which feels nicer. It also makes it easier to change this (eg. if we embedded them in the SDK) in future.\r\n\r\n@pq I suspect you have a fancy way to move issues (there's a bot? I don't know how it works), so I'll leave that to you.",
