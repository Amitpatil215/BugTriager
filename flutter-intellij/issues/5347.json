Make sure it does *not* open directly into an existing project, but instead opens the \"Welcome to IntelliJ IDEA\" dialog. Close project if it opens directly to a project, which should return you to the welcome dialog.\r\n2) Select the 'Projects' tab on the left side.\r\n3) Select the 'New Project' button at the top. The 'New Project' dialog opens.\r\n4) Select 'Flutter' on the left side.\r\n5) Select the 'Next' button at the bottom. The next screen of the 'New Project' dialog will display.\r\n6) The \"Platforms:\" section has a checkbox for 'Linux', but it is unchecked, and disabled, so that it is not checkable. I'm opening this issue assuming that it should be checkable.

            "body": "@aromanelli Thanks for the offer. I'll take you up on that.\r\n\r\nThere is something wrong with your IntelliJ. I see you have both Dart and Flutter plugins installed yet neither is listed in the `Languages & Frameworks` section. I don't know how that can happen. They should both be there. Furthermore, your `flutter doctor -v` output includes Android Studio but not IntelliJ. \r\n\r\nWhat happens if you try to create a project using Android Studio 4.2 or Arctic Fox? There is no platform selection in 4.1.\r\n\r\nWhat happens if you use the latest stable version of the Flutter plugin (not the dev channel)? This bug is fixed in version 54.1. (I mean, unless you've found a new bug.)\r\n\r\nWhat happens if you use the stable channel of the Flutter SDK? You can [download](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/linux#install-flutter-manually) it to a temporary directory if you don't want to risk messing up your project.\r\n\r\nIf you still have time and nothing has worked, try installing IntelliJ from the [download page](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=linux) and use that.\r\n\r\nYou should expect to see both Dart and Flutter listed in the `Languages & Frameworks` section, and the `Linux` check box enabled in the new project wizard. If you get the first but not the second then you probably have found a new bug.",

Seems like things have been 'in progress' since 2018.\r\n\r\nI had just assumed that flatpak would have the same current support as snap from the jetbrains guys in 2021, and that was my bad. Hopefully they give it full support, would be kind of awkward if the more proprietary snap system having better support that the flatpak one.\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned before, I'll just stick with the native installed version for now, until the dust clears.\r\n\r\nThanks for your efforts!",
