It's an AS/IntelliJ feature, not a Dart or Flutter plugin feature.\n\n---\n\n@dark-chocolate commented on [Tue Aug 28 2018](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/21118#issuecomment-416683323)\n\nDo you know how to solve it? I although added it to Google Tracker issues. Last time I reported something, they took around 45 days to get back to me. Don't know how much time will they take now?\n\n---\n\n@zoechi commented on [Tue Aug 28 2018](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/21118#issuecomment-416705459)\n\nReporting in a repo that is not related to the software that is rsponsible for the issue won't improve response time ;-)\n\n---\n\n@dark-chocolate commented on [Tue Aug 28 2018](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/21118#issuecomment-416706333)\n\nHow to delete the issue then?
