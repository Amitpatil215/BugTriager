The Flutter project must have been created as a Module (`flutter create --template module`, or using the Module type from Android Studio's new project wizard). Edit your Android code as instructed in the add2app doc,\r\nhttps://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Add-Flutter-to-existing-apps#use-the-flutter-module-from-your-java-code\r\n\r\nYou may need to re-sync the files with Gradle in the Android project, if `Flutter` can't be resolved. That's easy with `File > Sync Project with Gradle Files`, but really should be done automatically. Launch it and switch to the Flutter module project (you can have both projects open in separate windows, recommended). Click the `Flutter Attach` button on the toolbar if you want to debug it. Just make sure to attach before activating the Flutter code.\r\n\r\nFor this demo I just created a simple Android app with a Basic Activity then edited the code to replace the onClickListener. After launching I clicked the Mail icon.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"312\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-12-06 at 10 47 48 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8518285/49605375-28f4ed80-f945-11e8-9ec3-81ed0e58bc36.png\">\r\n",
