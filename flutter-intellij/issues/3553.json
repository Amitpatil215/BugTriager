The directory structure is (simplified):\r\n- MyApplication\r\n  - app\r\n  - sample\r\n\r\nThe \"MyApplication\" and \"app\" directories were created by Android Studio, using a simple app template. The \"sample\" directory was created from the command line via:\r\n `flutter create --template=module --org=com.example.sample sample`\r\n\r\nAfter adding and editing various configuration files I was able to get Flutter support in the same project window as the Android app.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1401\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-06-12 at 8 40 42 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8518285/59365807-0b3a8380-8cee-11e9-9658-a5ef53fd217c.png\">\r\n\r\nYou can see in that screen shot that hot reload worked when the Flutter module was launched as a stand-alone app, and that Java syntax highlighting is present. Code completion works for both Flutter and Java files in the Flutter module. Since the root project is an Android app all the Android Studio support is available for it, too.\r\n\r\nIt is going to require a bit of work in the Flutter module template (in flutter_tools) to get this working out of the box. I had to add a Gradle build script to the Flutter project. I needed to change the sample.iml file to look more like an Android module rather than a Java module. And I had to edit `.idea/modules.xml` to add the Flutter module to the Android project. There may be more work required to get everything working; I just wanted to see if the basic approach was valid.\r\n\r\nAs for actual work that could be done in the IDE, we can add a new type of module to the New Module Wizard in Android Studio. We already have the ability to import an existing Flutter module, but we could add another option to create a new Flutter module and link it in to the Android project.\r\n\r\n@xster Is this what you had in mind?",
