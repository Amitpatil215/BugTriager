Renaming/moving multiple items at once is not yet supported (it requires additional server work).\r\n\r\nSupporting this in Android Studio / IntelliJ will require some additional changes in its plugin (both to pass folder renames through, and also to provide some way of cancelling in the case of starting a large folder rename and wanting to abort if it's slow).",
