    "body": "Note: This is not asking for allowing dart:mirrors in flutter.\r\n\r\nCode generation is one good alternative to runtime reflection for Flutter. The code generation steps are usually run by\r\n```\r\nflutter pub run build_runner build\r\n```\r\nwhich is a pure dart process that allows `dart:mirrors` but does not allow `dart:ui`. And dart:mirrors is often useful for code generation, especially for type checks. For example, it was used in `source_gen`.  \r\n\r\nHowever, when my builder/generator code tries to import `dart:mirrors`, IntelliJ prompts me the \"target URI does not exists\" and shows an error, while both `flutter pub run build_runner build` and running `main.dart` finishes successfully. Also, when I wrote tests for that builder, it cannot be run through the IDE without manually creating a \"Dart Tests\" configuration. I think this is inconvenient for writing builder code that needs `dart:mirrors`, also it is an inconsistency between the IDE and the compiler. \r\n\r\nOne possible solution (without any automated detection) is to utilize the \"Mark as\" function of IntelliJ. When a source file is marked as \"pure Dart code\", it should be able import `dart:mirrors` and not able to import any flutter library such as `dart:ui`. When a test is marked as \"pure Dart code\", Dart Tests instead of Flutter Tests should be automatically generated.\r\n",
