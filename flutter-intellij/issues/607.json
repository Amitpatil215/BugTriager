(Note that at one point it _may have been_ --- we've updated to a new version of the Community Edition platform and it's possible that we're being affected by a change there.)\r\n1. Adding an `.idea` directory with the right metadata within seems to resolve the issue.\r\n\r\nAn `idea` directory can be created by:\r\n\r\n* opening the project using the **New Project** flow, or by\r\n* opening a dart file (`.dart`, `pubspec.yaml` or `flutter.yaml`) and accepting the IDE's offer to add a Flutter module type to the project\r\n\r\nA few things to do:\r\n\r\n1. add `.idea` metadata to the Flutter repo\r\n1. document the work-arounds above\r\n1. improve the open flow in general (as captured in #316 et al)\r\n\r\nFWIW: I'm not confident that updating the metadata in the repo will ever be sufficient to ensure that an example Flutter project is reliably recognized as having a Flutter module in all IDEA platforms.  From what I can tell we're depending on internal (and un-documented) implementation details that are subject to change. I think we'll have to double-down on the flow for opening projects missing metadata regardless.",
