We can track the fraction of users that stop and restart the app and also never run hot reloads from Flutter analytics.\r\nIf this is high, we should consider a message in IntelliJ suggesting using hot restart along with a tip for how to use hot restart any time this pattern of behavior is identified. We could even have this prompt ask users if they were aware of hot restart to fully understand where users are going wrong.\r\n\r\nI believe hot restart is featured more prominently in the VSCode toolbar. \r\nComparing the number of hot restarts from vscode could also clarify this issue.\r\n\r\nFYI @DanTup as VSCode users might also struggle with this.",
