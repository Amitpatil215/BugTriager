    "body": "The latest Flutter Project template in Android Studio contains a dependency reference to flutter_lint which isn't included as a part of the standard Flutter Installation. This can cause issues when attempting to start a new project while not connected to the internet since Android Studio doesn't support pub get in 'offline' mode and running flutter pub get --offline in Chipmunk builds isn't picked up by the IDE. This leaves you unable to use code inspection, build runners, or other dart lang features needed to work on your project. It would be helpful in the future to not include references to libraries or packages that aren't a part of the standard Flutter environment.\r\n\r\nFlutter Plugin 70.0.2\r\n\r\nAndroid Studio Chipmunk | 2021.2.1 Patch 2\r\nBuild #AI-212.5712.43.2112.8815526, built on July 10, 2022\r\nRuntime version: 11.0.12+0-b1504.28-7817840 aarch64\r\nVM: OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM by JetBrains s.r.o.\r\nmacOS 11.6.8\r\nGC: G1 Young Generation, G1 Old Generation\r\nMemory: 2048M\r\nCores: 8\r\nRegistry: external.system.auto.import.disabled=true\r\nNon-Bundled Plugins: Jetbrains TeamCity Plugin (2021.2.99602), Dart (212.5744), io.flutter (70.0.2)\r\n\r\n[flutter_doctor.txt](https://github.com/flutter/flutter-intellij/files/9536175/flutter_doctor.txt)\r\n",
