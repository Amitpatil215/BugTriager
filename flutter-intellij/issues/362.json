This seems sensible. We may want to add an option in the launch configuration for a flutter app to specify running in hot or non-hot mode. Then the debug button in IntelliJ would map to both hot and non-hot variants of the debug run mode.\n\nWe then need to figure out what exactly we map the run button in inteliij to. Our options are:\n- flutter run --release\n- flutter run (--debug), but we don't try and hook up a debugger and set breakpoints\n\nDo users need to be able to run release mode apps on their phones from intelliJ? Is this a use case that can be handled solely by the CLI? What is the user intention when they hit run? Do they just want to see their app running on the phone but not be bothered by breakpoints? Would they be surprised if a more deploy-mode time app runs when they hit the run button?\n\nthoughts @flutter/intellij-contribs?\n",

            "body": "I think the purpose of the IntelliJ Run button is to get your application running in the same fashion as if it were deployed, regardless of which platform you are developing for. You want to see how well it performs when there is no debugging overhead. This mode is needed for final system testing. The fact that Flutter does not currently have a release mode for simulators is a deficiency they may need to address but I don't believe that should affect our design.\n\nI am curious what motivates this question, though. Why would we want to make the Run button launch in debug mode with no debugger connected?\n\nIntelliJ also has a \"Run with Coverage\" button which I had been assuming would eventually be connected to the Profile mode.\n",

That error message can come from flutter_tools, but be presented well by IntelliJ. This keeps the release supported device knowledge in flutter_tools instead of IntelliJ.\n",

When a new project is created, create now one but two build configs:\n   - One called 'Debug': Like the current one, and with the combo box set to 'Debug mode'\n   - One called 'Release': Like the current one, and with the combo box set to 'Release mode'\n3. Default the run config box to 'Debug'\n4. The Run and Debug actions only differ in whether breakpoints are enabled or not\n5. The Run and Debug actions take the build type setting of the active build config into account:\n   - Build config == Debug: They `flutter run`\n   - Build config == Release: They `flutter run --release`\n6. If a user hits Run and Debug, and the current config is set to release, and the current target is a simulator, then the action simply fails and a meaningful error is printed to the Console (i.e., no fancy disabling and enabling of buttons)\n\nWDYT?\n\nThis seems most consistent with how other IDEs do it.\n",

We had a discussion in person based on the comments on this issue and evaluated the behavior of Android Studio's hot reload functionality. What we plan to execute on:\n\n## the debug button\n- is based on flutter run --hot and allows debugging\n- is very similar to the current behavior, modulo:\n- when an app is running, the debug button becomes a hot reload action\n\n## the run button\n- is also based on flutter run --hot\n- it _does not_ support debugging; no breakpoints are hit and it will not break on exceptions\n- when an app is running, the run button becomes a hot reload action\n\nFor both of the above, we will change the state of the run and debug buttons for running apps:\n- we'll change the enablement when the button is applicable but not currently supported (the run button becomes disabled when the app is starting up)\n- we'll change the icon image when an app is running. The run button will change from a simple play image to a play image with a lighting bolt decoration\n\nThis closely matches the behavior of android studio and I think is a reasonable mapping of the IntelliJ UI on flutter's execution behavior.\n\n![unnamed_1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1269969/19951425/20d9618c-a11b-11e6-9303-35348252693a.png)\n\n![unnamed_2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1269969/19950495/141ce30c-a115-11e6-99e4-3f172b7215e7.png)\n\nWe'll likely rely on users using the CLI for the less frequently used run options (`--release`). Going forward we may create a separate launch configuration type (`Flutter Release` or some such) that allows users to see the deployment build behavior of their app.\n",
