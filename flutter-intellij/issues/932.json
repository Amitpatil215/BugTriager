    "body": "Seems like we should give the user feedback as to whether there are any changes that are not hot-reloaded into the currently running Flutter App. One possibility would be to disable the lightning bolt when there are no changes to make.  So, behavior would be that it starts out greyed out, you type something, the lightning bolt lights up, and then you know to press it to see your changes in the app, and this becomes a way to train users to press the lightning bolt.\r\n\r\nSo the UI is simple. However, behind the scenes, calculating whether there are changes to make might be tricky.\r\n\r\n",
