The Wizard you get by clicking on \"Start a new Flutter Project\" from the Welcome screen.\r\n \r\n  > Not clear what this means. If \"no wizard appeared\" when you did something to cause a wizard to appear, what was it that you did? \r\n\r\nUser had Android studio installed and working for normal android projects. They install Flutter, Flutter Plugin, and Dart Plugin. On the \"Welcome\" screen, there is no option to \"Start a new flutter project\" nor is the \"New Flutter Project\" available in the File > New menu. There was just no way to create a Flutter project from Android Studio.\r\n \r\n  > If \"options to create\" were not present then did you do something that should have invoked the wizard?\r\n\r\nIt appears the solution was to wipe out the Android Studio preferences directory and start fresh. That wasn't a viable option for this person since they had Android Studio properly configured for their day-to-day Android work, so we never got the \"New Project Wizard\" working and had to create the app via the command line.\r\n\r\nOverall, it was just a bit of a rough first experience for a new Flutter user, and it might be worth investigating.",
