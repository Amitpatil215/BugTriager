Android Studio was working a few hours ago, installed in /usr/local, and I upgraded it to the most recent version by deleting the android-studio folder and extracting the zip installer.  Now my entire install is broken, and running studio.sh gives me an error: \r\n\r\n`Error: Could not find or load main class Didea.plugins.host=<https:..github.com.flutter.flutter-intellij>\r\n`\r\n\r\nAnd that's all I can get it to tell me.  I'm pretty upset because I have no idea how to configure these plugins, where they're stored, how they're loaded, etc. and the error gives me none of this information.  I have been working on flutter apps for the past few weeks without issue and this really took me by surprise.\r\n\r\n## Version info\r\nchristian@SUDOWUDO:/usr/local/android-studio$ flutter doctor -v\r\n[✓] Flutter (Channel beta, v0.2.8, on Linux, locale en_US.UTF-8)\r\n    • Flutter version 0.2.8 at /home/christian/flutter\r\n    • Framework revision b397406561 (12 days ago), 2018-04-02 13:53:20 -0700\r\n    • Engine revision c903c217a1\r\n    • Dart version 2.0.0-dev.43.0.flutter-52afcba357\r\n\r\n[!] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK 27.0.3)\r\n    • Android SDK at /home/christian/Android/Sdk\r\n    • Android NDK at /home/christian/Android/Sdk/ndk-bundle\r\n    • Platform android-27, build-tools 27.0.3\r\n    • Java binary at: /home/christian/android-studio/jre/bin/java\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_152-release-1024-b01)\r\n    ✗ Android license status unknown.\r\n\r\n[✓] Android Studio (version 3.0)\r\n    • Android Studio at /usr/local/android-studio\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_152-release-1024-b01)\r\n\r\n[✓] Android Studio (version 3.1)\r\n    • Android Studio at /home/christian/android-studio\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_152-release-1024-b01)\r\n\r\n[✓] VS Code (version 1.21.1)\r\n    • VS Code at /usr/share/code\r\n    • Dart Code extension version 2.11.1\r\n\r\n[!] Connected devices\r\n    !
