This blocks several features for the embedded Android project, such as documented here: [Resource Manager](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/resource-manager)\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Running Arctic Fox 2020.3.1 Patch 3 and Flutter plugin v61.2.2\r\n2. Attempting to access Resource Manager, for example this method does nothing:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5154664/139565963-bc4108e5-9293-4753-b21c-35af5d58e489.png)\r\n\r\n3. No mention of the Resource Manager besides this location and no other way to access the Resource Manager for Flutter projects.\r\n\r\nAs a result we cannot access the Resource Manager and especially the Configure Image Asset tool for creating Android Adaptive Launcher icons for Flutter projects, for example cannot get access to this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5154664/139566631-1f0e463e-5ba5-4dc6-8a55-bace4ccf4098.png)\r\n\r\n",
