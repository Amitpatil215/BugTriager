Or, if the branch is \"release_20\" the command would be `plugin --release=20 build`. The --release option is global so goes before the command. In either case, the actual value of the option would be inserted into the <version> tag.\r\n\r\n@pq We can talk about what should be the default. I chose this way just so there'd be fewer chances to mess up the upload. Which, in this case, worked as expected even though it doesn't look like it :) My concern is that I'd accidentally upload when I didn't intend to if --release were not required for deployment. I thought people would want to use `plugin build` somewhat often for local testing. If that's not the case then changing the default would make sense.",
