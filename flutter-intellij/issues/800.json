It's also common to start with a stateless widget and then convert it to a stateful widget later on.

            "body": "Here's a possible solution that I'd like feedback regarding usability. If this is usable we can build this, and others, into the Flutter plugin.\r\n\r\nThe basic idea is to create a custom live template that expands into the definition of a new StatelessWidget subclass. Open Preferences/Settings and search for the Live Templates page. Here's what mine looks like when finished.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1117\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-03-14 at 10 53 40 am\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8518285/23914889/8f3741a8-08a4-11e7-9f2f-6c450738e47d.png\">\r\n\r\nGetting there requires a few steps.\r\n* First, create a new template group by clicking the `+` (under \"Reset\" on the right side) and select option 2. Call it \"Flutter\".\r\n* Select it and click the `+` again.\r\n* Choose option 1. You can put anything you want in the `<abbreviation>` field. I chose \"stless\" (more about that later).\r\n* Give it a description like \"Stateless widget\" that will show up in the menu.\r\n* Paste your expansion code into the text pane.\r\n* Change \"Foo\" to \"$SELECTION$\" and insert \"$END$\" where the user should start typing.\r\n* At the bottom click the `Define` button next to \"No applicable contexts yet.\"\r\n* Expand `Dart` and select the `Other` beneath it. (This is a bit flakey, I think. I had to deselect `Dart` and reselect `Other` to eliminate statement applicability.)\r\n* Click `OK` to save the new template.\r\n\r\nYou can use the template in two ways: select the template from a menu or type \"stless\" and hit Tab. Your cursor needs to be outside a class definition for the template to be available.\r\n\r\nIf you type \"stless<tab>\" the template will be expanded and your cursor will be left at the position of the new class name. If you select the template from a menu then you can get an additional shortcut by typing the name of the new class, selecting it, then selecting the template from the menu (Cmd-Opt-J on Mac or Cmd-Opt-T on Mac). Cmd-Opt-J has the advantage of putting `stless` at the top of the list. Once the template is expanded your new class is defined and the cursor is left in the arguments of `new Container()`.\r\n\r\nI know it is asking a lot to have someone experiment with this. But if this is actually useful it would be simple to add templates for all the suggestions in this issue to the Flutter plugin.\r\n\r\nAlso, $SELECTION$ can appear multiple times. Here's the output of a Stateful widget template (after reformatting):\r\n\r\n```Dart\r\nclass LongComplexFlutterClassNameThatGetsTypedOnce extends StatefulWidget {\r\n  @override\r\n  _LongComplexFlutterClassNameThatGetsTypedOnceState createState() =>\r\n      new _LongComplexFlutterClassNameThatGetsTypedOnceState();\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass _LongComplexFlutterClassNameThatGetsTypedOnceState\r\n    extends State<LongComplexFlutterClassNameThatGetsTypedOnce> {\r\n  @override\r\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\r\n    return new Container();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n/cc @sethladd @mit-mit ",

The whole process might be more intuitive and informative if you gave the user a dialog with a brief explanation of what the template was for and fields for the template variables (the stateful widget with an animation controller template could have variables for both the class name and the animation controller variable name). \r\n\r\nSimilarly a template dialog might enable making an informed decision about selecting a different template. For example: the user selects the basic 'new stateless widget' template which says: if the widget's layout is to be animated, then use the 'new Animated widget' template instead. Clicking that would switch templates and help educate developers about the options.\r\n\r\nIf wishes were horses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I used Cmd-Shift-RightArrow to select the word and Cmd-Opt-J to bring up the menu.\r\n\r\nIf you think this would be useful we'd probably just add some of these templates to the next release. They are quite easy to define.\r\n\r\nCreating a tool to automatically convert stateless to state-full, or add an animation controller, is a lot more work. The conversions would probably be useful to more people, though. As you indicate, using the IntelliJ \"assist\" (Alt-Newline) feature to implement the conversion may not be optimal. Defining a new refactoring operation would allow displaying a form where various bits could be filled in. It would be a lot more discoverable if we add something to the `Refactor` menu.\r\n\r\n/cc @pq ",
