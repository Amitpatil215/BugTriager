It is a usability issue and it appears to be within the limits of intellij sdk. (is it?)",

Editing a line after it already has a color values makes the  color icon stop being editable for some reason. For example, adding a `const` where one was missing reproduces this.\r\n2. Color values like `Colors.red` display a color picker but the value is not saved which is  confusing and makes it seem like our code editing functionality is broken. I think users would prefer to save the color value even if it overrides a nice material color constant with a hex value. We can tackle fixing up color values to reuse existing color constants with a separate lint and quick fix. I would suggest we emit color values as `Color(0xFFAF9299)`. As a bonus we could emit the color as a Colors.foo constant if the exact value matched one of the material colors but that isn't crucial for an MVP. We could also consider adding a lint and quick fix that detects any case where a user is specifying colors as raw values when there are appropriate constants. https://github.com/dart-lang/linter/issues/2983\r\n\r\n",
