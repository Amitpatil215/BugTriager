As I know, right now there is no way to look at all the descdendets of the Decoration class, other than the Implementers section on this page: https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/painting/Decoration-class.html \r\n\r\nIt would be a nice addition to the flutter IDE support, to make the descendants of the abstract classes visible, as a recommendation, rather than the abstract class itself. \r\n\r\nIf it is not possible, there is an easy way to solve this, by adding all the descendents in the abstract classes header section.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18382875/87533143-77777b80-c694-11ea-9132-40a0e4753ebf.png)\r\n\r\nIt would make the beginner's life easier and would increase productivity by a slight.\r\n\r\nI hope it gets implemented in the future, alltough if there's a way right now to show the appropprite recommendations, I would be all ears for it :)\r\n\r\n",

Or just type the name (somewhere that it will be interpreted as a class) and select it, then use that menu.\r\n\r\nI believe we have a project to improve completion suggestions. FWIW the descendants of Decoration do show up in the list but you have to scroll quite a way to find them. It clearly needs improvement.\r\n\r\n@pq should this be moved to the SDK? Or is it too specific to Flutter?",
