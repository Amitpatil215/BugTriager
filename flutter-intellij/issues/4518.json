The tests were failing as well. Now the gutter button is not at the test name anymore, but on the next line:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow I can't Run or Debug individual tests, they are all Run at once.\r\n\r\nI am using IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate 2020.1.\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\nI came with some more weird cases:\r\n\r\nI tried to add as simple test to reproduce the bug described before:\r\n\r\n\r\nAs you can see the previous test has the gutter Run button on the wrong line and the Simple Test has no gutter button at al. But as soon as I create the Simple Test it had the button, I used it to run it, and after it completed the button just disappeared.\r\n\r\nIf I just edit the contents of my test (type Enter then Backspace) the IDE fixes it self and shows the gutter buttons:\r\n\r\n\r\nBut as soon as I use them they just disappear again like in reported before on item 1.\r\n\r\nAttachments 3\r\nimage.png\r\n image1.png\r\n image2.png",
