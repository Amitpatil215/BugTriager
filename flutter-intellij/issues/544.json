Until your description I would not have thought of clicking after the 'card' text to resume searching. The re-orientation into 'where you were' is fairly important in this context.\r\n\r\nIt also interferes with the 'what did the UI tell me that I needed to know about card again?' interaction. This happens when people are e.g. trying to remember the option arguments list that appeared. They got to that piece of UI by performing a code completion request, so it's typical that they will try and return there using the same interaction again.",

Probably I never mixed selection and completion, I can't think out a real use case that would lead me to this situation.\r\n\r\nThough I thought a bit and found this behavior reasonable. Picking an item from the completion list is an editor action similar to typing a word. When you have any selection and start typing - selection is removed and substituted with what you type. And the same happens when you pick an item from the completion list: if there is any selection - it is substituted with the picked item. That's why it makes no sense to check prefix matching when the prefix is selected - it will be overwritten anyway. I believe it is done by design.",
