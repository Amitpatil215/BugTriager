    "body": "So, now when you are programming with the dart null safety, sometimes the ide gives you a warning and a suggestion \"Add a null check (!)\".\r\n\r\ni would like to have a suggestion that instead of adding the null check doSomeThing(obj.local!.id), it would refactor this line to something like this\r\n\r\n          var local = obj.local;\r\n          if(local != null){\r\n            doSomeThing(local.id);\r\n          }\r\n\r\nThe \"!\" is ok for things that you will use just once, but if you plan to use for example that 'local' variable in other places of the code bellow you don't want to use the \"!\" every time you need local, so i think it would be cool to have an alternative action for the \"Add a null check (!)\"\r\n\r\nThis could save a lot of time.",
