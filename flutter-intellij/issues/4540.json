Instead, the value is generating the `child:` line or the `children:[]` array, or in the case of the builders, the actual builder function.\r\n\r\nBuilders are the most problematic because most builder functions differ in signature, and on top of that, they all take different required parameters.\r\n\r\nI'm not the sure the heuristic of \"widgets...most common in user code\" is necessarily a good one because the frequency of use doesn't reflect the tediousness of adding the widget. If you again consider something like `LayoutBuilder`, I may only use that once in my app, but I'd be far more appreciative of not having to lookup that builder function signature online than I would to have quick access to a `Center` widget, which only saves me a couple seconds vs the generic \"wrap with widget\"\r\n\r\nPS - I understand that the needs of beginner Flutter developers may be different here. I am transparently saying this as someone who knows most of the widgets that are available.",

Some intentions do open a dialog. Usually they are intentions that have an clear intent to open a dialog and they do not modify code. Example: select a piece of Java code, there'll be 'Adjust code style settings' intention that opens a dialog.\r\n\r\nFor intentions that modify code, showing a dialog sounds like a too heavy solution. Lightweight popups that *don't require* user action but allow to change something in the intention behavior look more appropriate. But this will probably require changes both in the Analysis Server protocol and in the Dart plugin.\r\n\r\nBy the way, Analysis Server and IntelliJ already support so called 'linked edits' with suggestions list. Can they help to improve the wrapping usability?",
