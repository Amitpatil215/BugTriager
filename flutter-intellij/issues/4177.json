Well, strictly speaking, `Reformat Code with dartfmt` actions stays the same (reformats the whole file) but you don't actually need this action anymore.

And since 2019.3 `Ctrl+Alt+L` with selection applies `dartfmt` result for the selection only.\r\n\r\nFor the reference: https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/WEB-41609",
