However, these templates are a significant nuisance for developers who are working in source code.\r\n\r\nI routinely jump into Flutter source to read docs, only to find a `@macro` where I was expecting documentation. I have the same problem in my own source code where macros are used.\r\n\r\nI'd like to see one or both of the following in the IDE:\r\n\r\n- Source linking for template macro's so that I can `CMD+B` to the definition of the template.\r\n- Automatic IDE expansion of a macro template so that I can read a template inline, as if it were written in the source code docs that I'm reading.",

It uses its own index to find declarations, so go-to-declaration changes would have to be implemented there. That would require the Dart parser to recognize `@macro` and add `@template` and `@macro` to the index.\r\n\r\nIf the analysis server supported `@macro` then we could, in theory, add support in the Flutter plugin. But the analyzer doesn't currently recognize `@macro` AFAIK. @bwilkerson might know more.\r\n\r\n@DanTup is this something that could be added to VS Code? I saw that LSP had the basic protocol, but I doubt the analyzer handles `@marco` there, either.",
