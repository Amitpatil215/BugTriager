It didn't matter if I was building for an emulator or for a real device, I tried Invalidate Caches and Restart and it did the same. I reverted any code changes I had made, but nothing worked and I had to reboot my computer each time, for a total of four times. \r\n\r\nHonestly I should have probably tried compiling a smaller test project, but naturally I wanted to build what I was working on. \r\n\r\n## Version info\r\n\r\nflutter doctor -v\r\n[√] Flutter (Channel dev, 1.19.0-1.0.pre, on Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.18362.836], locale en-GB)\r\n    • Flutter version 1.19.0-1.0.pre at C:\\Users\\micha\\AppData\\Local\\flutter_1.5.4\r\n    • Framework revision 456d80b9dd (3 weeks ago), 2020-05-11 11:45:03 -0400\r\n    • Engine revision d96f962ca2\r\n    • Dart version 2.9.0 (build 2.9.0-7.0.dev 092ed38a87)\r\n\r\n[√] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 29.0.2)\r\n    • Android SDK at C:\\Users\\micha\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\sdk\r\n    • Platform android-R, build-tools 29.0.2\r\n    • Java binary at: C:\\Program Files\\Android\\Android Studio\\jre\\bin\\java\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_242-release-1644-b01)\r\n    • All Android licenses accepted.\r\n\r\n[√] Chrome - develop for the web\r\n    • Chrome at C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe\r\n\r\n[√] Android Studio (version 4.0)\r\n    • Android Studio at C:\\Program Files\\Android\\Android Studio\r\n    • Flutter plugin version 46.0.2\r\n    • Dart plugin version 193.7361\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_242-release-1644-b01)\r\n\r\n[√] IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition (version 2019.3)\r\n    • IntelliJ at C:\\Program Files\\JetBrains\\IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 2018.3.4\r\n    • Flutter plugin version 44.0.3\r\n    • Dart plugin version 193.6494.35\r\n\r\n[√] VS Code (version 1.45.1)\r\n    • VS Code at C:\\Users\\micha\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Microsoft VS Code\r\n    • Flutter extension version 3.10.2\r\n\r\n[√] Connected device (3 available)\r\n    • SM G965F   • 21a97bb0230c7ece • android-arm64  • Android 10 (API 29)\r\n    • Web Server • web-server       • web-javascript • Flutter Tools\r\n    • Chrome     • chrome           • web-javascript • Google Chrome 83.0.4103.61\r\n\r\n• No issues found!",
