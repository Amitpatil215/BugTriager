(and rightfully so)\r\nAll I ask is that you please do not present any **Project** settings within the **Application** settings dialog. That will surely ruin the user experience. (At least for me it does)\r\nFor the apple platform there is even an explicit design guideline against that. (See link in my previous post)  On the windows side I am afraid there are no such rules that I am aware of. Still there are best practices and customs that one should try to adhere to.  \r\n\r\nAnd of course intellij has a dedicated dialog for the project specific sdk settings. \r\nFor the Mac and windows versions it can be found under: \r\n**File > Project Structure > Platform Settings > SDKs**\r\n(with Linux it should be the same)\r\n\r\nThanks!",

Unfortunately, the problem (if any - not everybody agrees it's a problem) is not obvious and not easy to fix to satisfy all kinds of IDE users.
