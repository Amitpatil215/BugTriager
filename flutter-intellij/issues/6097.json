Run a code path that would trigger the breakpoint.\r\n\r\nThe app stops at a seemingly random location (not anywhere near the original breakpoint, although it consistently stops at the same point relative to the original breakpoint you set).\r\n\r\nI see two errors in the console:\r\n\r\n```\r\nChromeProxyService: Failed to evaluate expression 'modelsToSave': InternalError: No frame with index 32.\r\nChromeProxyService: Failed to evaluate expression 'logger.': InternalError: No frame with index 32.\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut, interestingly enough, if I open up the Chrome debugger (while doing the above as if normal debugging is to occur). The Chrome debugger actually breaks on the correct line, and you can see in the Chrome debugger window the source code for the dart file (correctly formatted) -- no idea how Chrome debugger is working perfectly and intellij is not. \r\n\r\n## Version info\r\n\r\n```\r\n[âœ“] Flutter (Channel stable, 2.10.4, on macOS 12.2.1 21D62 darwin-arm, locale en-US)\r\n    â€¢ Flutter version 2.10.4 at /Users/tc.ferguson/flutter-sdk\r\n    â€¢ Upstream repository https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git\r\n    â€¢ Framework revision c860cba910 (3 weeks ago), 2022-03-25 00:23:12 -0500\r\n    â€¢ Engine revision 57d3bac3dd\r\n    â€¢ Dart version 2.16.2\r\n    â€¢ DevTools version 2.9.2\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 33.0.0-rc1)\r\n    â€¢ Android SDK at /Users/tc.ferguson/Library/Android/sdk\r\n    â€¢ Platform android-32, build-tools 33.0.0-rc1\r\n    â€¢ Java binary at: /Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jre/Contents/Home/bin/java\r\n    â€¢ Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.10+0-b96-7249189)\r\n    â€¢ All Android licenses accepted.\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Xcode - develop for iOS and macOS (Xcode 13.3)\r\n    â€¢ Xcode at /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer\r\n    â€¢ CocoaPods version 1.11.2\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Chrome - develop for the web\r\n    â€¢ Chrome at /Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Android Studio (version 2020.3)\r\n    â€¢ Android Studio at /Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents\r\n    â€¢ Flutter plugin can be installed from:\r\n      ðŸ”¨ https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9212-flutter\r\n    â€¢ Dart plugin can be installed from:\r\n      ðŸ”¨ https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6351-dart\r\n    â€¢ Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.10+0-b96-7249189)\r\n\r\n[âœ“] IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition (version 2021.3.3)\r\n    â€¢ IntelliJ at /Users/tc.ferguson/Applications/JetBrains Toolbox/IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate.app\r\n    â€¢ Flutter plugin version 66.0.3\r\n    â€¢ Dart plugin version 213.7306\r\n\r\n[âœ“] IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition (version 2021.3.3)\r\n    â€¢ IntelliJ at /Users/tc.ferguson/Library/Application Support/JetBrains/Toolbox/apps/IDEA-U/ch-0/213.7172.25/IntelliJ IDEA.app\r\n    â€¢ Flutter plugin can be installed from:\r\n      ðŸ”¨ https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9212-flutter\r\n    â€¢ Dart plugin can be installed from:\r\n      ðŸ”¨ https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6351-dart\r\n\r\n[âœ“] IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition (version 2021.3.2)\r\n    â€¢ IntelliJ at /Users/tc.ferguson/Library/Application Support/JetBrains/Toolbox/apps/IDEA-U/ch-0/213.6777.52/IntelliJ IDEA.app\r\n    â€¢ Flutter plugin can be installed from:\r\n      ðŸ”¨ https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9212-flutter\r\n    â€¢ Dart plugin can be installed from:\r\n      ðŸ”¨ https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6351-dart\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Connected device (1 available)\r\n    â€¢ Chrome (web) â€¢ chrome â€¢ web-javascript â€¢ Google Chrome 100.0.4896.75\r\n\r\n[âœ“] HTTP Host Availability\r\n    â€¢ All required HTTP hosts are available\r\n\r\nâ€¢ No issues found!\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm running Flutter IntelliJ plugin version 66.0.3 (But I also tried downgrading to a 64.x.x version as I found a similar issue closed prior that seemed maybe related -- but it did not resolve this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd a screenshot just for good measure:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1562915/162852866-666ab70d-ca86-4ffa-bf09-d76aa237ddd4.png)\r\n\r\n",
