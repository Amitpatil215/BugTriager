My colleague is working a windows computer, so he can't run/test/debug on a Mac at all.\r\n\r\nWhat Xamarin does is it allow you to choose a Mac machine on your network, then when you want to deploy on an iOS device, it build the iOS app on the deported Mac (where the IDE is also installed, I think they dialog as simple http client/server) and then go back to windows once it's done to install the build on the device. Then you can run/debug iOS app on a Windows machine. \r\n\r\nI can imagine this feature is quite huge to implement, but that one thing that was really useful/attractive for developers. ",
