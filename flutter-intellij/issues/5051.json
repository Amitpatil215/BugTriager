            "body": "I cannot reproduce this problem. I _think_ it's due to a change in Android Studio last summer. When the project tool window is set to \"Android\" it won't display any files for Flutter projects. Switch to any other project type and it works. I usually use \"Project\".\r\n\r\nHowever, my menus work as expected. And the latest test showed that the \"Android\" view displayed files for the Flutter \"android\" directory. Lately, it has just showed \"Loading...\". It seems to be a timing issue with Android Studio 4.1.\r\n\r\nUsing Android Studio 4.2, files are displayed after the Gradle build finishes. It shows \"Loading...\" for a while, then displays the files.\r\n\r\nWe recommend using another window until 4.2 is stable. Another possibility is to enable the experimental option in Flutter preferences named \"Enable code completion, navigation, etc. for Java / Kotlin\". It if works for you then you won't have to open another window.",
