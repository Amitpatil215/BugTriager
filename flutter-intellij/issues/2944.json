The concept is to run simulations varying themes that apply to determine which themes are actually having an effect.\r\n\r\nCurrently it can take 20 minutes to track down a theme bug.  With the right tools it should be 1 minute.\r\n@willlarche do you have any concrete examples of hand to debug theme cases? Step 1 in finding a good solution is to have some representative problem examples that we can use while developing tools and while running user studies to iterate on those tools.\r\n",
