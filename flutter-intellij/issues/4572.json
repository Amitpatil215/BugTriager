Start writing code in a .dart file, create a few empty lines, have an unfinished line of code - and then switch to another application. When you return to Android Studio, the code have been reformatted without the user actually saving the file.\r\n\r\nExpectation: When I switch to another application (for example a browser to look up a code sample) and return to Android Studio, my code is just as I left it - probably half-finished, extra empty lines, unformatted.\r\n\r\nObservation: When I switch to another application (for example a browser to look up a code sample) and return to Android Studio, my code has been reformatted just as if I pressed command+S (or manually saved the file).\r\n  \r\n## Version info\r\n[✓] Flutter (Channel stable, v1.17.1, on Mac OS X 10.15.4 19E287, locale en-GB)\r\n    • Flutter version 1.17.1 at /Users/andrew/flutter\r\n    • Framework revision f7a6a7906b (2 weeks ago), 2020-05-12 18:39:00 -0700\r\n    • Engine revision 6bc433c6b6\r\n    • Dart version 2.8.2\r\n\r\n[✓] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 29.0.3)\r\n    • Android SDK at /Users/andrew/Library/Android/sdk\r\n    • Platform android-29, build-tools 29.0.3\r\n    • Java binary at: /Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jre/jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_212-release-1586-b4-5784211)\r\n    • All Android licenses accepted.\r\n\r\n[✓] Xcode - develop for iOS and macOS (Xcode 11.5)\r\n    • Xcode at /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer\r\n    • Xcode 11.5, Build version 11E608c\r\n    • CocoaPods version 1.9.0\r\n\r\n[✓] Android Studio (version 3.6)\r\n    • Android Studio at /Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents\r\n    • Flutter plugin version 45.1.1\r\n    • Dart plugin version 192.8052\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_212-release-1586-b4-5784211)\r\n\r\n[✓] VS Code (version 1.45.1)\r\n    • VS Code at /Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents\r\n    • Flutter extension version 3.10.2\r\n\r\n[✓] Connected device (1 available)\r\n    • iPhone 11 Pro Max • 9C273367-2A8F-4F93-8E1B-868E86BB6A24 • ios •\r\n      com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimRuntime.iOS-13-5 (simulator)\r\n\r\n",
