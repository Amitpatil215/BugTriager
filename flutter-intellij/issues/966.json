Let it import the project from Gradle.\r\n* Added `compile 'com.android.support:support-v4:25.3.1' dependency in `android/app/build.gradle`.\r\n\r\nAt this point, I would normally expect a Gradle sync in IDEA to pick up the added dependency and just work, but it didn't. I actually had to\r\n\r\n* Build -> Build Project\r\n\r\nAfter that, `LocalBroadcastManager` (and whatever else I wanted from support) was available in IDEA.\r\n\r\nSo, looks like the Android dependencies are fetched from the `android/build` directory, since `LocalBroadcastManager` stopped working in the IDE when I removed that directory.\r\n\r\nI don't think we should try to work around this, and if we do, it should only be temporary until this issue is fixed upstream.\r\n\r\nAlso note that I didn't open `foo/` in IDEA. That project doesn't look like it's set up correctly for native Android development. In particular, it doesn't look like it uses Gradle, and it didn't pick up the new dependency even after I'd built the project.",

In particular you don't have hot reload, etc.\r\n\r\nIf you create a Flutter project in the normal way, we are not setting up Gradle integration at all. An \"android\" module is added which is really just a Java module with the SDK set to an Android SDK. Setting the Java classpath as well will allow more imports to be resolved.\r\n\r\nSo far I haven't managed to get Gradle integration and Flutter integration going at the same time. If you figure it out, we can see if we can do it automatically by changing the \"flutter create\" templates.",
