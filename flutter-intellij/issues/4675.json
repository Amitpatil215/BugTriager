However, I do not have any issues with code completion while the app is running.\r\n\r\nThis may be a lot to ask, but if you can reliably reproduce the problem, then while the IDE is frozen it might be helpful to get some data. The Mac Activity Monitor app could tell you if any process is using all the CPU time, and if any process is sending or receiving huge amounts of data. Unfortunately, I couldn't find anything useful in the stack trace. Except that it was blocked for 52 seconds (IIRC).\r\n\r\nDo you have Dart DevTools open when it hangs?",
