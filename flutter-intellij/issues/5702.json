    "body": "I have the Flutter plugin installed with IDEA. I've tried adding its Hot Reload (All Devices) and Hot Restart (All Devices) buttons to the Touch Bar of my Mac but they don't show up. Here are the screenshots. FYI, the single device hot reload and hot restart buttons don't work either. Some other Flutter-related buttons I've tested seemed working fine.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14371560/128441853-9c78e5bb-a799-43e7-bef4-05e3a6b4821d.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14371560/128441809-f8fabc9b-2a72-4cf6-88db-f62e7323b51f.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe issue was first reported directly to JetBeans ([issue](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-274377)), but I was redirected to this repository.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nOn a Macbook with Touch Bar, do the following:\r\n\r\n1) Open IntelliJ IDEA with Flutter and Dart plugins installed.\r\n2) Go to IntelliJ IDEA -> Preferences -> Appearance & Behavior -> Menus and Toolbars.\r\n3) Expand the \"Touch Bar\" menu item. Expand \"Default\".\r\n4) Remove some items to make some space and then add \"Hot Reload (All Devices)\" and \"Hot Restart (All Devices)\". (Single device options cause the same problem.)\r\n5) Apply and save.\r\n\r\n**Expected:** Items appear on the Touch Bar.\r\n**Actual:** They are not there.\r\n\r\n## Version info\r\n\r\n```\r\n[âœ“] Flutter (Channel stable, 2.2.3, on macOS 11.2.1 20D74 darwin-arm, locale ru-RU)\r\n    â€¢ Flutter version 2.2.3 at /Users/%username%/.flutter\r\n    â€¢ Framework revision f4abaa0735 (5 weeks ago), 2021-07-01 12:46:11 -0700\r\n    â€¢ Engine revision 241c87ad80\r\n    â€¢ Dart version 2.13.4\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 30.0.3)\r\n    â€¢ Android SDK at /Users/%username%/Library/Android/sdk\r\n    â€¢ Platform android-30, build-tools 30.0.3\r\n    â€¢ Java binary at: /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-15.0.1.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java\r\n    â€¢ Java version Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 15.0.1+9-18)\r\n    â€¢ All Android licenses accepted.\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Xcode - develop for iOS and macOS\r\n    â€¢ Xcode at /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer\r\n    â€¢ Xcode 12.5.1, Build version 12E507\r\n    â€¢ CocoaPods version 1.10.1\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Chrome - develop for the web\r\n    â€¢ Chrome at /Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome\r\n\r\n[!] Android Studio (version 2020.3)\r\n    â€¢ Android Studio at /Users/%username%/Library/Application Support/JetBrains/Toolbox/apps/AndroidStudio/ch-0/203.7583922/Android\r\n      Studio.app/Contents\r\n    â€¢ Flutter plugin can be installed from:\r\n      ðŸ”¨ https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9212-flutter\r\n    â€¢ Dart plugin can be installed from:\r\n      ðŸ”¨ https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6351-dart\r\n    âœ— Unable to find bundled Java version.\r\n    â€¢ Try updating or re-installing Android Studio.\r\n\r\n[âœ“] VS Code (version 1.58.2)\r\n    â€¢ VS Code at /Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents\r\n    â€¢ Flutter extension version 3.25.0\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Connected device (3 available)\r\n    â€¢ iPhone 11 Pro (mobile)     â€¢ D68FF329-3843-4136-9EA3-48B318886D68 â€¢ ios            â€¢ com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimRuntime.iOS-14-5\r\n      (simulator)\r\n    â€¢ iPhone 12 Pro Max (mobile) â€¢ 519B0D9F-9AF4-4A0F-90F9-EE56166E3065 â€¢ ios            â€¢ com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimRuntime.iOS-14-5\r\n      (simulator)\r\n    â€¢ Chrome (web)               â€¢ chrome                               â€¢ web-javascript â€¢ Google Chrome 92.0.4515.131\r\n    !
