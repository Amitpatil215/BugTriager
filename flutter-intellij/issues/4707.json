However, it recently stopped working and the configuration dialog has the error 'Directory is not in a pub root'. I don't fully understand this error, as there is a pubspec.yaml in the parent directory of the test folder. Is there some other mechanism that defines the directory as a pub root? The configuration looks like:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"746\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-07-20 at 6 48 37 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19588/88003410-ab4e0900-cab9-11ea-9198-a379c005f7cd.png\">\r\n\r\nI can run the tests fine from the command line, so I am not sure what is going on here. Not sure if it matters, but IDEA project was generated with the `flutter ide-config --overwrite` command.\r\n\r\n## Version info\r\n\r\n```\r\n[✓] Flutter (Channel master, 1.21.0-2.0.pre.66, on Mac OS X 10.15.5 19F101, locale en-US)\r\n    • Flutter version 1.21.0-2.0.pre.66 at /Users/darren/dev/flutter\r\n    • Framework revision 54c9441723 (3 days ago), 2020-07-17 18:56:12 -0400\r\n    • Engine revision d327828632\r\n    • Dart version 2.9.0 (build 2.9.0-21.0.dev 9dca49e71e)\r\n\r\n[✓] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 29.0.3)\r\n    • Android SDK at /Users/darren/Library/Android/sdk\r\n    • Platform android-29, build-tools 29.0.3\r\n    • Java binary at: /Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jre/jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_242-release-1644-b3-6222593)\r\n    • All Android licenses accepted.\r\n\r\n[✓] Xcode - develop for iOS and macOS (Xcode 11.6)\r\n    • Xcode at /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer\r\n    • Xcode 11.6, Build version 11E708\r\n    • CocoaPods version 1.9.1\r\n\r\n[✓] Android Studio (version 4.0)\r\n    • Android Studio at /Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents\r\n    • Flutter plugin version 47.1.2\r\n    • Dart plugin version 193.7361\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_242-release-1644-b3-6222593)\r\n\r\n[✓] IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition (version 2020.1.3)\r\n    • IntelliJ at /Applications/IntelliJ IDEA.app\r\n    • Flutter plugin version 47.1.3\r\n    • Dart plugin version 201.8538.45\r\n\r\n[✓] VS Code (version 1.47.2)\r\n    • VS Code at /Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents\r\n    • Flutter extension version 3.12.2\r\n\r\n[✓] Connected device (1 available)\r\n    • macOS (desktop) • macos • darwin-x64 • Mac OS X 10.15.5 19F101\r\n\r\n• No issues found!\r\n```",
