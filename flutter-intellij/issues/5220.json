Once AS is restarted the problem disappears.\r\n\r\nDescription and steps to reproduces are given below.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**\r\n 1. Open existing Flutter project in Android Studio;\r\n 2. Create a new variable;\r\n 3. Click Alt+Enter to import the variable's class;\r\n 4. The Dart package is imported;\r\n 5. Launch Android emulator\r\n 6. Create another variable;\r\n 7. Click Alt+Enter to import the variable's class;\r\n *Expected*: class is imported\r\n *Actual*: No import suggestions are given. When writing the class name, no autocomplete\r\n\r\n**Software versions**\r\nWindows 10 Pro x64\r\nAndroid Studio 4.1.2\r\nAndroid Emulator 30.3.5 version\r\n\r\n**Flutter doctor**\r\nFlutter (Channel stable, 1.22.5, on Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.19042.685], locale lt-LT)\r\n\r\n**System**\r\nDell Precision 7540\r\n\r\nI tried googling for this but haven't found similar questions. I guess this is related to what ports are used by the Dart analysis server and the Android emulator. Restarting AS 20 times per day doesn't seem like an efficient solution.",
