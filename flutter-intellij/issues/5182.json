There was a change to not list the web-server device. That is generally only used for special cases and was confusing for most users wrt when should they choose web chrome vs web server. It's still available for those special cases, you just have to pass the device id explictly (when running from the command line).\n—\nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub [https://github.com/flutter/flutter-intellij/issues/5182#issuecomment-765621457], or unsubscribe [https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ACAZR6GA7MVCZKEVQNRSLGTS3HDNBANCNFSM4WGD6RHA].",
