I thought that the plugin should respect the package name that I provided during the project creation step.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you create a new Android project from Android Studio or Xcode, if you provide an application ID or a bundle identifier during the project creation step, it will become an app ID/bundle ID as-is, without any modification.\r\n\r\nAlso, is there any reason why the plugin adds those postfix? Also, it's hard to understand why its naming convention is inconsistent between Android and iOS. (snake case vs. camel case)\r\n\r\n",
