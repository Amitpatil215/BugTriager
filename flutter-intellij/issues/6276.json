If your issue is related to the Flutter framework itself,\r\nplease open an issue at\r\n[github.com/flutter/flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/new).\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nTried to rename a directory with `[Righ click]->Refactor->Rename` unticking `[ ] Search for comments and strings`, this causes IDE not to rename the corresponding directory path in imports.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11217296/182020832-1bf30783-b82a-4f9c-8a51-588850a25ab0.png)\r\n\r\nExpected them to be changed, since imports are a part of the code structure.\r\n\r\nSuggestion: add an addition tick box, when changing directories to include coded references such as `import` and `include` etc.\r\n\r\n## Version info\r\n\r\nPlease paste the output of running `flutter doctor -v` here (available from the command\r\nline or from `Tools > Flutter > Flutter Doctor`). It will provide the version of the\r\nFlutter framework as well as of the IntelliJ plugin.\r\n\r\n```\r\nPS C:\\FlutterProjects\\m_work_admin> flutter doctor -v\r\n[√] Flutter (Channel beta, 3.3.0-0.1.pre, on Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.22000.795], locale nb-NO)\r\n    • Flutter version 3.3.0-0.1.pre on channel beta at c:\\Flutter\\flutter\r\n    • Upstream repository https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git\r\n    • Framework revision d952ca86d6 (4 days ago), 2022-07-27 10:33:00 -0700\r\n    • Engine revision fd131c385e\r\n    • Dart version 2.18.0 (build 2.18.0-271.4.beta)\r\n    • DevTools version 2.15.0\r\n\r\n[√] Android toolchain -
