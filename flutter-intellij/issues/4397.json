    "body": "Hi, \r\n\r\nI recently updated to Android Studio 3.6 running on Linux. After the updated, I started up Android Studio to work on my flutter project and I was asked to update the Dart & Flutter plugins for Android Studio so I did just that. After completing the updates I tried to continue working on my project but now I'm having an issue with new dart files when I make them. \r\n\r\nThe syntax highlighting is not working at all with the new dart files as seen in the first photo.![Screenshot_20200226_140236](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26792040/75351861-b69d5f80-58a0-11ea-909e-730be56cf92d.png)\r\n\r\nIn the second one, it seems the syntax highlighting is only working with return types, method types and classes\r\n![Screenshot_20200226_141235](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26792040/75352707-1811fe00-58a2-11ea-839b-7e448be00e25.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nIv tried disabling the plugins, restart the IDE and then enabling them again with zero luck. I have also disabled my theme plugin in case maybe that is what was causing it but it doesn't seem to be.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is my `flutter doctor -v` report\r\n\r\n[✓] Flutter (Channel dev, v1.15.3, on Linux, locale en_IE.UTF-8)\r\n    • Flutter version 1.15.3 at /home/cathal/Development/flutter\r\n    • Framework revision 67826bdce5 (2 weeks ago), 2020-02-10 14:59:32 -0800\r\n    • Engine revision 6158f03ef5\r\n    • Dart version 2.8.0 (build 2.8.0-dev.8.0 514a8d4c84)\r\n\r\n \r\n[✓] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 29.0.2)\r\n    • Android SDK at /home/cathal/Android/Sdk\r\n    • Android NDK location not configured (optional; useful for native profiling support)\r\n    • Platform android-29, build-tools 29.0.2\r\n    • ANDROID_HOME = /home/cathal/Android/Sdk\r\n    • Java binary at: /opt/android-studio/jre/bin/java\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_212-release-1586-b4-5784211)\r\n    • All Android licenses accepted.\r\n\r\n[✗] Chrome - develop for the web (Cannot find chrome executable at google-chrome)\r\n    !
