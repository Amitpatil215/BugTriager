Please read\r\n     our guide to filing a bug first: https://flutter.dev/docs/resources/bug-reports\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Use case\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n     Please tell us the problem you are running into that led to you wanting\r\n     a new feature.\r\n\r\n     Is your feature request related to a problem? Please give a clear and\r\n     concise description of what the problem is.\r\n\r\n     Describe the alternative solutions you've considered. Is there a package\r\n     on pub.dev/flutter that already solves this?\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIt'll be easier for some developers to click on `Build > Flutter > Build web` instead of running `flutter build web` on the terminal.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n     Briefly but precisely describe what you would like Flutter to be able to do.\r\n\r\n     Consider attaching images showing what you are imagining.\r\n\r\n     Does this have to be provided by Flutter directly, or can it be provided\r\n     by a package on pub.dev/flutter? If so, maybe consider implementing and\r\n     publishing such a package rather than filing a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdd support for web under `Build > Flutter` menu. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"442\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-10-07 at 11 08 33 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4143153/136314343-613e7ff1-3c7c-4d6b-a030-41480425a94e.png\">\r\n\r\n",
