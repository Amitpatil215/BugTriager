The service extensions on flutter attach are added from a different location than where they are added on app restart. The before-mentioned [PR](https://github.com/flutter/flutter-intellij/pull/2871) affects adding service extensions on app restart. However, on start and attach, service extensions are added from [here](https://github.com/flutter/flutter-intellij/blob/master/src/io/flutter/server/vmService/VMServiceManager.java#L128) and do not require a Flutter.FirstFrame event to be added. On flutter attach, there are no service extensions to restore (like in the restart case), so the crash fixed by [PR](https://github.com/flutter/flutter-intellij/pull/2871) should not occur in flutter attach.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe this is the right long term fix: add an extension to query flutter asking if it has rendered a frame. The info is already stored to distinguish first vs subsequent frames. Internally call the extension and then add everything if the first frame has been called - otherwise, you would wait and add everything when the first frame occurs.\" - @jacob314 ",
