This is using IDEA CE without the Android plugin.\r\n\r\n*Which JDK should we use for Android?*\r\n\r\nI got this out of \"flutter doctor\". It looks like it picks it up from Android Studio? Presumably flutter-tools will need to choose this.\r\n\r\n*Where do we get android.jar?*\r\n\r\nAgain, got it out of \"flutter doctor\". It's $ANDROID_HOME/android-25/android.jar. Again, flutter tools should tell us where it is.\r\n\r\n*Where do we get javadoc for Android API's?*\r\n\r\nAssuming it's installed,  $ANDROID_HOME/sources/android-25 should contain all the Java source files. In IDEA, this should be attached to android.jar.\r\n\r\n*How should IDEA refer to android.jar?*\r\n\r\nI put Java configuration in a separate module for the \"android\" subdirectory. I think it's a hack, though; it should be part of the Android SDK. I suspect you need to enable Android support to create an Android SDK, though.\r\n\r\n*Where do we get flutter.jar?*\r\n\r\nThis seems to be defined by source code in a gradle file: \r\n\r\n   $FLUTTER_HOME/packages/flutter_tools/gradle/flutter.gradle\r\n\r\nFor a debug compile, its location is apparently:\r\n\r\n   $FLUTTER_HOME/bin/cache/artifacts/engine/android-arm/flutter.jar\r\n\r\n*Where do we get javadoc for flutter.jar?*\r\n\r\nI haven't found it yet. But it appears that Android Studio doesn't set this up properly either.\r\n\r\nAdding these two jars is good enough to get rid of the errors in MainActivity, except for a warning that MainActivity is never used. Presumably using Android integration would fix that.\r\n\r\nSo it looks like setting this up isn't too hard for the simple case, but making sure it stays up to date as the user modifies the Android/Flutter settings might be tricky. When ANDROID_HOME changes or the platform version changes  (according to flutter doctor) we need to use a different android.jar, and when FLUTTER_HOME changes (or is updated) then we might need to change the location of flutter.jar.",

As the name implies, this creates a single *module*. There are some hooks allowing it to also create a new project with a single module.\r\n\r\nThe base of the class hierarchy is named `ProjectBuilder` and it has a `commit` method that can return multiple modules. However, there are no examples other than ProjectImportBuilder (and subclasses) that actually do this; it appears we're on our own.\r\n\r\nThe entrypoint for creating a new project (or module) is `FlutterModuleType`, which implements createModuleBuilder(), whose return type is \"T extends ModuleBuilder\". This suggests we're not really supposed to create multi-module projects this way. Perhaps there's some other way to register it?\r\n\r\nLooking in [LangExtensionPoints.xml](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community/blob/master/platform/platform-resources/src/META-INF/LangExtensionPoints.xml), I don't see an obvious alternative to the moduleType hook.\r\n\r\nAn alternative might be to stick with a single module and a single module type (Flutter) and enable Java support somehow, but that seems messy.",

I would love to ctrl+click in AS and see actual sources of flutter.jar.\r\n\r\n**Edit:** sorry for resurrecting a year-old closed bug, but I thought relevant information could also help others. I checked out the https://github.com/flutter/engine/ source and pointed IntelliJ to shell/platform/android in it. Probably the version would not match the actual source version used for flutter.jar, though.  ",
