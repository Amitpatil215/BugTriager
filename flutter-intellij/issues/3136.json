Because of this, we need to get references to views to work on them in Java. (Of course Kotlin lets you avoid that.) The layout file itself would be written in XML and consist of Views and ViewGroups.\r\nFlutter uses a completely new approach where instead of Views, you use widgets. A View in Android was mostly an element of the layout, but in Flutter, a Widget is pretty much everything. Everything from a button to a layout structure is a widget. The advantage here is in customisability. Imagine a button in Android. It has attributes like text which lets you add text to the button. But a button in Flutter does not take a title as a string, but another widget. Meaning inside a button you can have text, an image, an icon and pretty much anything you can imagine without breaking layout constraints. This also lets you make customised widgets pretty easily whereas in Android making customised views is a rather difficult thing to do .\r\nfrom Site : \r\nhttps://medium.com/@dev.n/answering-questions-on-flutter-app-development-6d50eb7223f3 \r\n\r\ncheck also https://flutterstudio.app \r\nwhich help you creating flutter deffrent elements such as buttons , text much other things just by Draging .",
