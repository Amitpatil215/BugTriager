It only works if  [there is a hint or an error](https://i.ibb.co/jH735gp/Screen-Shot-2021-04-18-at-22-03-23.png) that the linter suggests.\r\nActually, I've been facing this issue for a couple of weeks now. It didn't bother me much then but it is now started to be annoying. For example, when I want to wrap a widget with another widget, I copy-paste the entire widget and create the new widget, and manually assign the copied widget to its child.\r\n\r\nI have also tried it with IntelliJ IDEA but the behavior is the same.\r\n\r\n## Version info\r\n```\r\n[âœ“] Flutter (Channel stable, 2.0.4, on Mac OS X 10.15.7 19H524 darwin-x64, locale en-TR)\r\n    â€¢ Flutter version 2.0.4 at /Users/apple/SDK/flutter\r\n    â€¢ Framework revision b1395592de (2 weeks ago), 2021-04-01 14:25:01 -0700\r\n    â€¢ Engine revision 2dce47073a\r\n    â€¢ Dart version 2.12.2\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 30.0.2)\r\n    â€¢ Android SDK at /Users/apple/Library/Android/sdk\r\n    â€¢ Platform android-30, build-tools 30.0.2\r\n    â€¢ Java binary at: /Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jre/jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java\r\n    â€¢ Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_242-release-1644-b3-6915495)\r\n    â€¢ All Android licenses accepted.\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Xcode - develop for iOS and macOS\r\n    â€¢ Xcode at /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer\r\n    â€¢ Xcode 12.4, Build version 12D4e\r\n    â€¢ CocoaPods version 1.10.0\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Chrome - develop for the web\r\n    â€¢ Chrome at /Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Android Studio (version 4.1)\r\n    â€¢ Android Studio at /Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents\r\n    â€¢ Flutter plugin can be installed from:\r\n      ðŸ”¨ https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9212-flutter\r\n    â€¢ Dart plugin can be installed from:\r\n      ðŸ”¨ https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6351-dart\r\n    â€¢ Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_242-release-1644-b3-6915495)\r\n\r\n[âœ“] IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition (version 2020.3)\r\n    â€¢ IntelliJ at /Applications/IntelliJ IDEA CE.app\r\n    â€¢ Flutter plugin can be installed from:\r\n      ðŸ”¨ https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9212-flutter\r\n    â€¢ Dart plugin can be installed from:\r\n      ðŸ”¨ https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6351-dart\r\n\r\n[âœ“] VS Code (version 1.55.2)\r\n    â€¢ VS Code at /Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents\r\n    â€¢ Flutter extension version 3.21.0\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Connected device (1 available)\r\n    â€¢ Chrome (web) â€¢ chrome â€¢ web-javascript â€¢ Google Chrome 89.0.4389.128\r\n\r\nâ€¢ No issues found!\r\n```",
