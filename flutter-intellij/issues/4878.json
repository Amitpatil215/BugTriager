    "body": "Pressing `ctl+enter` in Android Studio brings up a menu with auto-generation options. This is often used to generate `==` and `hashCode` methods.\r\n\r\nIn Flutter there is often a need for a `copyWith` method, which is used to duplicate an existing data structure with some number of alterations. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmyTheme.copyWith(\r\n  brightness: Brightness.dark,\r\n  primaryColor: Colors.yellow,\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nA `copyWith` method might look like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass MyThing {\r\n  const MyThing({\r\n    this.itemA,\r\n    this.itemB,\r\n    this.itemC,\r\n });\r\n\r\n final String itemA;\r\n final int itemB;\r\n final bool itemC;\r\n\r\n MyThing copyWith({\r\n   String thingA,\r\n   int thingB,\r\n   bool thingC,\r\n}) {\r\n  return MyThing(\r\n    thingA: thingA ?? this.thingA,\r\n    thingB: thingB ?? this.thingB,\r\n    thingC: thingC ?? this.thingC,\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think it would be a good idea to add a generation option for a `copyWith` method, with a generator that would look and operate almost identically to that of `==` and `hashCode`.",
