(It won't even open the file unless there's a need to do so in order to analyze a non-excluded file). The problem arises when the user later opens the file. At that point we have two choices: either we continue to hide the diagnostics or we display them. If we hide them, then some users are confused because all of the other IDE features work and they assume that the absence of diagnostics means that the file analyzed cleanly when it didn't. If we display them, then some users are confused because they asked us to exclude the file from analysis.\r\n\r\nWhich is the better failure mode?",
