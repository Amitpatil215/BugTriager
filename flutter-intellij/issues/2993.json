            "body": "There are a lot of unknowns here. Depending on when the project was created, deleting the `.idea` directory will also delete the `*.iml' file describing the Android module. When Gradle re-creates it the module will not have any Flutter-specific settings because Android does not have any built-in Flutter knowledge. OTOH if the project is older, then the `.idea` file might be safely deleted -- that was common practice some months ago. The Flutter project templates have changed a lot since embedding Flutter into an Android app became an explicit goal.\r\n\r\nEditing Gradle files that are used by Flutter could also cause problems, depending on what was done and what version of Gradle the project is expecting to use. This is way out of my depth, though. I do know that the most recent version of the Flutter project templates (particularly the \"module\" template) attempt to separate the user-editable from non-editable files. Doing `flutter make-host-app-editable` clarifies which files are to be edited and which are not. Flutter drives Gradle itself when the app is launched; it does not expect Android Studio to drive (or sync) Gradle. We do have some preliminary support for syncing Gradle in Android Studio to generate libraries in the Flutter project so that Java code can be edited alongside Flutter, but that's still experimental (see Flutter's preferences).\r\n\r\nIf you can give us a sample project with steps to reproduce the problem we might be able to help. It sounds like a really unfortunate problem, but this is the first I've heard of it; would be good to eliminate it before others are bit.",

It happens in the IntelliJ support for Gradle projects, and according to Jetbrains it is working as intended.\r\n\r\nThere's a work-around embedded in this PR, which should be available in the M40 release:\r\nhttps://github.com/flutter/flutter-intellij/pull/3850\r\n\r\nFurther discussion is on this issue at Jetbrains:\r\nhttps://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/WEB-40082\r\n\r\nIt looks like the \"correct\" solution might be to define a Dart plugin for Gradle, which knows how to preserve the Dart-specific metadata. I don't think that's going to happen anytime soon. Contributions welcome :)",
