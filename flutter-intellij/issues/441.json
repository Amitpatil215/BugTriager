They both report one progress event now (one spinner) for the full duration of the task, and emit some text at the end to let the user know that the operation is complete. From the command-line this looks like:\n\n```\nPerforming hot reload...                            344ms\nReloaded 0 of 441 libraries.\n\nPerforming full restart...                          1105ms\nRestart complete.\n```\n\nFrom IntelliJ we translate the cli spinner to the IntelliJ progress UI, and route the 'completion' text to the console. This both lets the user know that the task is occurring and when it completes.\n",
