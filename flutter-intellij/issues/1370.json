Flutter won't overwrite existing files, so the lines we add to workspace.xml that cause two files to be opened do not get written, since workspace.xml is one of the files created early.\r\n\r\nThere may be a way to initialize the project with two files open. I'll look into that. Someday. I don't think it is high priority.",
