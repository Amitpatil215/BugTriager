In VS Code we only run it when you explicitly run the command, so it's probably not hit all that much.\r\n\r\n> we may want to change to a mechanism where the index if built on the flutter chromium bots, and included as part of the SDK\r\n\r\nI think both @pq and I would much prefer something like that, but when we previously discussed it there were generally two issues:\r\n\r\n1. We don't have a good way of including things in the SDK that come from building it (eg. if a git commit kicks off the build, we can't have it commit the samples back to the repo). Probably it'd need to be downloaded based on the hash or something (like other artifacts)\r\n\r\n2. The original design of downloading samples was deliberate to allow users to get new templates even if they're not on the same SDK version (though I'm not sure this idea is all that useful since the docs only update with stable releases, and we probably don't need to optimise for people on non-current stable releases).\r\n\r\nMoving the download from the editors to Flutter was a short-term fix to reduce them being out-of-sync (the `flutter create` command switches hostname for downloading the samples based on your Flutter branch, and we didn't want to leak that logic into the editors). I definitely think we need a plan for improving this though.",

The issue is when the index we use and the website are out of sync. If our index has different samples in it compared to what's on the live docs (or `master` docs) then the user might pick a sample (from the index) and then get an error during creation (because `flutter create` tried to get that sample from the live site).\r\n\r\nWe moved away from the local indexes after there were \"breaking changes\" to those sample IDs (numeric suffixes) with resulted in errors. If we go back to shipping indexes, we need to be reasonably sure the sample IDs on the websites won't change unexpectedly again (probably they won't, the previous issue seems like a one-off).\r\n\r\n> > If we want to continue to support this sample creation flow, we should update the sdk to include the samples index.\r\n> \r\n> I think this is really the best option. @DanTup: WDYT?\r\n\r\nYep, this makes sense to me as a better fix. I'm not sure what the work is to do this though - I think all the current artifacts are built and uploaded as part of an internal build (and possibly all in the engine, not the Flutter repo?). ",
