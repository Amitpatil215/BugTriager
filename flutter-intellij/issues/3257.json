We have to do a lot of path traversal to support various functions, such as \"Open for editing in Android Studio\". Someday we'll revisit that code but I don't think it will be soon enough to help this case. If you want to keep working this way you can; some things won't work (like the suggestion below) but much will.\r\n\r\nWhile this won't help for Xcode, you can enable an option (for _each_ project) to allow editing of Android Java & Kotlin code in the same window as the Flutter code. You'll need to have the plugin open as a top-level project. (You might want to set the System Setting \"Open project in new window\".) Open the Flutter plugin preferences and set this checkmark, then restart:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"607\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-03-13 at 10 39 34 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8518285/54301514-596ba980-457c-11e9-824d-3909a7fc2514.png\">\r\n\r\nWe don't enable it by default because most people don't want to wait for Gradle analysis. If you're wondering why we can't do that for Xcode, it would require us rewriting Xcode in IntelliJ (which isn't going to happen) or getting JetBrains to package their AppCode product as a plugin that we could add to Android Studio (or vice versa), which has only slightly better odds of happening.",
