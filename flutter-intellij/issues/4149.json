When using a breakpoint I would like to know which instance a given by provider. \r\n\r\n Would be nice to have the instance ID of the object to be able to identify it:\r\n<img width=\"1659\" alt=\"Capture d’écran 2019-11-29 à 13 15 28\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2970449/69868557-53545f00-12aa-11ea-9545-9ff7a02cfc30.png\">\r\n\r\nHere I would like to know which CashRegisterBloc it is but can't easily.\r\n \r\nAs you can see it's done for widgets/states but not for plain objects. It's a shame as it can really simplify debugging such use case (that can happen even without provider involved). \r\n",
