I open a Flutter project in Android Studio and I'm greeted with: \r\n\r\n<img width=\"254\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-08-13 at 3 54 45 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/919717/90194997-55e5de80-dd7d-11ea-90cc-56054920021c.png\">\r\n\r\nTapping the selector does nothing to remedy this:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"192\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-08-13 at 3 50 19 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/919717/90195047-6bf39f00-dd7d-11ea-90c6-b812e88f0163.png\">\r\n\r\nThis is happening for minutes, if not forever.\r\n\r\nThe interesting part is that `flutter devices` works on the command line:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ flutter devices \r\n2 connected devices:\r\n\r\nPixel 2 XL (mobile)            • 711KPZK05XXXXX            • android-arm64 •\r\nAndroid 10 (API 29)\r\nFilip Hracek’s iPhone (mobile) • 00008020-00067128XXXXXXXE • ios           • iOS\r\n13.1.3\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seemingly doesn't matter what devices or how many I have connected.
