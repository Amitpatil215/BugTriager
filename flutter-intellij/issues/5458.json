You can add the 'abstract' keyword before the class declaration.`\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/351125/116929346-aca98600-ac34-11eb-9a40-1aecd0700430.png)\r\n\r\nHow do I solve my issue? Well, I just need remove the abstract keyword, which is already highlighted and there is even a red lamp.\r\n\r\nHowever... can't the IDE suggest this (i.e. let the IDE remove it)? It should be a veeery small implementation to make this possible, but would help a lot of people.\r\n\r\nSuggestion 2:\r\n\r\n```dart\r\nabstract class MyClass {\r\n\r\nabstract void method() {};\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\ninstead of just removing the \"abstract\", it could infer from the empty {} that the user wants a ; (since it is common in this scenario, when coming from other languages). Therefore, it could remove the abstract and add a ;.",
