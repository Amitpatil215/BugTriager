My colocated tests are in a test/ subfolder of the directory where the code they are tested is located. So tests for lib/src/foo/bar.dart are in lib/src/foo/test/bar_test.dart\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create an identical test file in `test/foo/bar_test.dart` and `lib/src/foo/test/bar_test.dart`.\r\n2. Right-click the file in `test/foo/bar_test.dart` and run it, it runs the tests with `flutter test` as expected.\r\n3. Right-click the file in `lib/src/foo/test/bar_test.dart` and run it, it runs the tests with `dart test` when it should be `flutter test`. ~~Note that when clicking the gutter icon inside the file to run an individual test it correctly uses `flutter test`~~ I just retried this and it's not working, I think I was mistaken.\r\n\r\n### example test file\r\n\r\n```dart\r\nimport 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';\r\n\r\nvoid main() {\r\n  group('right click run test', () {\r\n    test('dummy test', () {\r\n      expect(1, equals(1));\r\n    });\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Version info\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>flutter doctor</summary>\r\n\r\n```\r\n[âœ“] Flutter (Channel stable, 2.10.3, on macOS 11.5.2 20G95 darwin-x64, locale en-GB)\r\n    â€¢ Flutter version 2.10.3 at /Users/rorystephenson/sdk/flutter\r\n    â€¢ Upstream repository https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git\r\n    â€¢ Framework revision 7e9793dee1 (2 weeks ago), 2022-03-02 11:23:12 -0600\r\n    â€¢ Engine revision bd539267b4\r\n    â€¢ Dart version 2.16.1\r\n    â€¢ DevTools version 2.9.2\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 32.1.0-rc1)\r\n    â€¢ Android SDK at /Users/rorystephenson/sdk/android/\r\n    â€¢ Platform android-32, build-tools 32.1.0-rc1\r\n    â€¢ ANDROID_HOME = /Users/rorystephenson/sdk/android\r\n    â€¢ Java binary at: /Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jre/Contents/Home/bin/java\r\n    â€¢ Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.11+0-b60-7590822)\r\n    â€¢ All Android licenses accepted.\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Xcode - develop for iOS and macOS (Xcode 13.2.1)\r\n    â€¢ Xcode at /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer\r\n    â€¢ CocoaPods version 1.11.2\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Chrome - develop for the web\r\n    â€¢ Chrome at /Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Android Studio (version 2021.1)\r\n    â€¢ Android Studio at /Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents\r\n    â€¢ Flutter plugin can be installed from:\r\n      ðŸ”¨ https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9212-flutter\r\n    â€¢ Dart plugin can be installed from:\r\n      ðŸ”¨ https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6351-dart\r\n    â€¢ Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.11+0-b60-7590822)\r\n\r\n[âœ“] VS Code (version 1.65.0)\r\n    â€¢ VS Code at /Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents\r\n    â€¢ Flutter extension version 3.34.0\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Connected device (1 available)\r\n    â€¢ Chrome (web) â€¢ chrome â€¢ web-javascript â€¢ Google Chrome 99.0.4844.74\r\n\r\n[âœ“] HTTP Host Availability\r\n    â€¢ All required HTTP hosts are available\r\n\r\nâ€¢ No issues found!\r\n```\r\n</details>",

There may be a bug in the implementation, because I thought it was supposed to work in \"lib\" without having to mark anything as a Test Sources Root (since \"lib\" is already marked as a Sources Root).
