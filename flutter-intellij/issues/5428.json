Thanks Brian for the correct info in https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/45809#issuecomment-825699286.\r\n\r\nThat's true that the IDE highlights all errors in a similar way (as well as all warnings, and all hints), and there's no exception for \"missing required parameter\" error. \r\n\r\nIt's theoretically possible to provide separate highlighting configuration for specific errors/warnings/hints but at this point this seems like an overdesign to me. There should be very strong reasons to treat some errors as more specific than the others. I'm not aware of such reasons.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, sorting by name in the Dart Analysis view should help with searching for errors of a specific type across the whole project.",

These NNBD errors are now the most common that happen just as you type. I'd say they are now more than 50% of the errors I get when I type. If you know right away if they are NNBD related, it makes it much easier to just fix them on the spot. Sorting by name in the Dart Analysis doesn't help, since the goal is to see right away the type of error as you type. Most of the time you just need to include a `?` or a `!` and that's easier to do as you type or paste something, since you have all the code context in mind. \r\n\r\nBut if that's close to impossible to implement, ok, we can live without it.
