Note how deep it is. (Actually, I didn't even expand the reference expression fully; the identifier is within it.)\r\n\r\nHere's what the same code looks like if (as Luke showed) you paste the string without first inserting the matching close-paren:\r\n<img width=\"1215\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-02-09 at 2 26 54 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8518285/23718870/03c9b7dc-03ee-11e7-945c-f78c12dad84a.png\">\r\n\r\nNote the relatively flat structure surrounding the \"h\" identifier. Also note the PsiErrorElement for the colon following \"children\". That marks a parsing error, way above the code that was pasted.\r\n\r\nThe implementation of auto-indent uses the parser and since the current parser doesn't have really good error correction it will require quite a lot of work to fix this issue. I have to agree with Alex's comment that using the simple form of paste is the best way to solve the problem.\r\n\r\nAs Phil and Luke suggest, we need better user education. Using Extend Selection along with Surround With Parens could also be useful in this example. Or, defining a Live Template with linked-editing may be the way to go.",
