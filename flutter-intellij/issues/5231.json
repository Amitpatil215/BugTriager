Besides a regular `main.dart` file, create a new file say `home.dart`, and keep your cursor in that file. \r\n2.

It looks kinda like a rounded rectangle with an\narrow in the top section, and has an orange line IIRC (middle of the night\nfor me, no IDE handy to check). I'm not sure why clicking `Run` would shift\nfocus to main.dart. But it is doing an entirely different thing than hot\nrestart. The hot restart button has hover text that shows \"Hot Restart\"\nIIRC; you could try to find that one then click it to see if it shifts\nfocus for you.\n\nOn Wed, Feb 3, 2021 at 12:46 AM Dark Chocolate <notifications@github.com>\nwrote:\n\n> @stevemessick <https://github.com/stevemessick>\n>\n> Also, I can't see the icon of the button you click to do hot restart.
