If it's basically never then I'd recommend hiding it and putting a 'show all files' somewhere in a menu.\r\n\r\nIf it's 'sometimes' then I'd recommend sorting the files and folders to the end and making them partially transparent.

            "body": "I like the idea of having `lib` node expanded and `main.dart` file focused in the Project View when opening a newly created project for the first time. This could be done by project generator - it could add the corresponding state to the generated `.idea/workspace.xml`. Of course on existing project opening, no magic should happen, IDE restores the previous state as it always does.\r\n\r\nI don't like the idea of reusing 'source folder' icon for a folder that is not a source folder according to the IntelliJ project model. Unlikely it can greatly help newcomers who do not know icons meaning. OTOH experienced users may be confused by project model and presentation inconsistency. \r\nAlso, suggested change affects non-Flutter Dart projects, but there sources are usually located in multiple folders: `lib`, `web`, `bin`, `tool`, `benchmark`, `example`, etc.\r\n\r\nMy $0.02.",
