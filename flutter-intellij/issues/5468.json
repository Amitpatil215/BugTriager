Not only `adb` or `xcrun`, we want it also for desktop and connected physical devices.\r\n\r\nI think, IntelliJ UI should simulate these features of browser:\r\n* developer can enter new URL in the address bar to send a deeplink command to the connected app\r\n* IntelliJ always listens to the current URL reported by the connected app and update accordingly\r\n* IntelliJ keep the list of reported URL in history so developer can always navigate to that URL again with single click. The URL history should work exactly like what we see in `chrome://history`",
