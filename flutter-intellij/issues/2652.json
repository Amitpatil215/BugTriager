The last two lines were:\r\n```console\r\nDownloading android-x86 tools...                                1383.6s\r\nDownloading android-x64 tools...                                1472.0s\r\n```\r\n(And this *should* have been really fast internet.)\r\n\r\nI didn't notice that immediately. When I tried to connect a device the Flutter plugin would not detect it. The device list stayed empty, or changed to `Loading...`. In any case, no devices were detected.\r\n\r\nI tried `flutter doctor` to see what the status was and was promptly informed:\r\n```console\r\nWaiting for another flutter command to release the startup lock...\r\n```\r\nThat's when I noticed the hung upgrade. I'm guessing when the plugin tried to find devices, it used a Flutter command that failed with the above message. We should detect that and report a configuration issue to the user.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, babysitting the upgrade command and ensuring it finished restored device detection.\r\n",
