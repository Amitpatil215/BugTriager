Hm... That's a lot of data. And most of the libraries don't changes their export namespace. Actually when the user types in file, it is usually in a method body, or in a class body, so top-level declarations don't change at all, not even for a single library. It's like `90%` chance. The next most probably case, let's say `8%` is when you actually change top-level declarations for a single library.\r\n\r\nWe could try to implement it with the current API, but it would be a huge waste. Ideally we should cache per-library completion suggestions and update them as needed.",
