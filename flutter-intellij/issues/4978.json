By giving the developer a choice which terminal to use, the developer could use a familiar terminal which they already use in another programming/other related tasks.\r\n\r\nFor example, AnsiColors, are not currently supported by Flutter Plugin yet in many terminals they are. Some people also prefer having the terminal separated from the IDE window.\r\n\r\nCurrently, you surely can start debugging your Flutter application with an external terminal, but you will lose the ability to hot-reload on save, you will lose all IDE buttons functionality.\r\n\r\nI hope this clarifies the use cases a bit.
