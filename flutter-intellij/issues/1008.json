I test on several devices and emulators:\r\nDevices: iPhone7, Gen 3 MotoX, Nexus 5\r\nSimulator: iPhone SE, Pixel\r\n\r\nAfter building enough times to some devices, at some point the device list will just stop updating.  I don't know what causes it exactly though.  But that's the use case.  Best advice I can give is try to build a complete app with flutter with several devices.    The issue can be fixed by restarting the IDE.\r\n\r\n## Version info\r\n```\r\n[‚úì] Flutter (on Mac OS X 10.12.4 16E195, channel master)\r\n    ‚Ä¢ Flutter at /Users/KG/Developer/Flutter/flutter\r\n    ‚Ä¢ Framework revision 5a9b525146 (4 days ago), 2017-05-05 11:27:15 -0700\r\n    ‚Ä¢ Engine revision 0071651ecb\r\n    ‚Ä¢ Tools Dart version 1.23.0-dev.11.11\r\n\r\n[‚úì] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK 25.0.2)\r\n    ‚Ä¢ Android SDK at /Users/KG/Library/Android/sdk\r\n    ‚Ä¢ Platform android-25, build-tools 25.0.2\r\n    ‚Ä¢ ANDROID_HOME = /Users/KG/Library/Android/sdk\r\n    ‚Ä¢ Java binary at: /Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jre/jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java\r\n    ‚Ä¢ Java version: OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_112-release-b06)\r\n\r\n[‚úì] iOS toolchain - develop for iOS devices (Xcode 8.3.2)\r\n    ‚Ä¢ Xcode at /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer\r\n    ‚Ä¢ Xcode 8.3.2, Build version 8E2002\r\n    ‚Ä¢ ios-deploy 1.9.1\r\n    ‚Ä¢ CocoaPods version 1.2.1\r\n\r\n[‚úì] Android Studio (version 2.3)\r\n    ‚Ä¢ Android Studio at /Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents\r\n    ‚Ä¢ Gradle version 3.2\r\n    ‚Ä¢ Java version: OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_112-release-b06)\r\n\r\n[‚úì] IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition (version 2017.1.2)\r\n    ‚Ä¢ Dart plugin version 171.4424\r\n    ‚Ä¢ Flutter plugin version 13.1\r\n\r\n[‚úì] Connected devices\r\n    ‚Ä¢ Android SDK built for x86 ‚Ä¢ emulator-5554                        ‚Ä¢ android-x86 ‚Ä¢ Android 7.0 (API 24) (emulator)\r\n    ‚Ä¢ Nexus 5X                  ‚Ä¢ 0106bcc49c8ca3eb                     ‚Ä¢ android-arm ‚Ä¢ Android 7.1.1 (API 25)\r\n    ‚Ä¢ iPhone SE                 ‚Ä¢ 046CD453-58EF-4F20-9C95-CDD2713DFADC ‚Ä¢ ios         ‚Ä¢ iOS 10.3 (simulator)\r\n```",
