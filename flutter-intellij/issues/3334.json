When you exclude files in IntelliJ you're telling the virtual file system to ignore them. Normally the VFS sends the analysis server a signal that a file has changed and it gets reanalyzed. But if you're telling the VFS to ignore the files then that signal won't get sent.\r\n\r\nYour dart processes look good; thanks.",

Excluded in the sens that they are under my `.gitignore` as I don't want then in versioning control. I tried to remove them from it but no more luck... \r\n\r\nBut I think I found the problem ! \r\nOn my analysis_options I have this: \r\n```\r\nexclude:\r\n    - 'bin/**'\r\n    - 'lib/l10n/messages/**'\r\n    - 'lib/**/*.*.dart'\r\n```\r\nMeaning that I don't want to have lint for generated file as they don't follow my conventions. But by doing that the analysis server is totally ignoring my changes ! I tried to remove the exclude rules and then it works ! So not sure if it's a problem on the plugin or on the analysis server :/ but at least we know the reasons ^^ ",
