You also have at least one project in which type hierarchy is not working properly for Flutter SDK classes. You are using the stable version of Android Studio with the latest versions of the Dart and Flutter plugin. You have the latest stable and dev channel for the Flutter SDK. The broken project is broken for both stable and dev channels.\r\n\r\nQuestions for @iLoveDocs:\r\nDoes the type hierarchy work correctly for your own code (that is, not SDK and not from pub)?\r\nDoes it work for code in a pub package?\r\n\r\nAnd, since I'm running out of ideas, could @alexander-doroshko or @bwilkerson suggest anything that might help?",

Maybe you guys can better understand it now. \r\n\r\nI removed that directory all together, and now I'm happy with the View Hierarchy. Thank you guys for helping me dig this issue. Much appreciated 👍 \r\n\r\n",
