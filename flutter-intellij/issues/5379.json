Opened the flutter-intellij repository in IntelliJ IDEA. I got a dialog box asking to `Load Gradle Project`. I accepted that.\r\n\r\n 2. Clicked on `Build -> Build Project` on Toolbar. Got these errors: \r\n\r\n\t- `java: package com.google.common.base does not exist`\r\n\t\t-> Please add `com.google.guava:guava:28.2-jre` maven dependency.\r\n\r\n\t - `java: package org.apache.commons.lang does not exist`\r\n\t\t-> I found this error was generated on every import statement:\r\n\t\t`import org.apache.commons.lang.StringUtils;`\r\n\t\tSo, I did a global 'Find and Replace' of above import statement to:\r\n\t\t`import org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils;`\r\n\t\tAnd the error was gone.\r\n\r\n\t- `java: package org.yaml.snakeyaml does not exist`\r\n\t\t-> Go to \r\n\t\tFile -> Project Structure -> Modules -> flutter-intellij -> Dependencies Tab -> Press '+' and add  [snakeyaml JAR](https://jar-download.com/artifacts/org.yaml/snakeyaml/1.23/source-code) dependency (please make sure to download 1.23 version only).\r\n\r\n\t- `package net.miginfocom.swing does not exist`\r\n\t\t-> Go to \r\n\t\tFile -> Project Structure -> Modules -> flutter-intellij -> Dependencies Tab -> Press '+' and add  [net.miginfocom.swing JAR](https://jar-download.com/maven-repository-class-search.php?search_box=net.miginfocom.swing) dependency (I have downloaded 5.2 version).\r\n\r\n3. Converted `testCompile` to `testImplementation` in `build.gradle`.\r\n\r\nAnd after all these steps, all the errors were gone. However few warnings were there stating:\r\n`Kotlin: Classpath entry points to a non-existent location`\r\nYou can ignore them.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, I ran the `flutter-intellij` Run/Debug Configuration and it ran successfully!\r\n\r\nHope this was helpful.",

We used to use Linux for CI but switched to MacOS. It is possible the Linux build is no longer working, but we need to look into that before making any changes.",
