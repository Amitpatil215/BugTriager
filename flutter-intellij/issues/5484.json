    "body": "TL;DR: \r\n\r\n_As a developer -sometimes- I introduce performance problems in my applications_ ðŸ˜…  **What if the Flutter plugin helps me detect and fix them?**\r\n\r\nFull story: \r\n\r\nReviewing some articles on recommendations to improve the performance of applications made with Flutter, I find some elements that could be added to the plugin to help developers improve the performance of their apps.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n- It is recommended not to use methods that create Widgets (or lists of Widgets) within the `build()` method. Instead, specific Widgets must be created (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVg9It7cOfY&t=1320s, https://blog.codemagic.io/how-to-improve-the-performance-of-your -flutter-app./#dont-split-your-widgets-into-methods)\r\n- It is recommended to use lazy lists instead of creating all items manually (https://flutter.dev/docs/perf/rendering/best-practices#render-grids-and-lists-lazily)\r\n- It is recommended not to use the `Opacity` widget (https://flutter.dev/docs/perf/rendering/best-practices#pitfalls)\r\n\r\nI am not an absolute specialist in performance with Flutter but I have debugged on other platforms and it is a very important element in mobile apps.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is that some of these items could appear as part of the warnings and/or as part of a specific performance analysis extension within the plugin.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?",
