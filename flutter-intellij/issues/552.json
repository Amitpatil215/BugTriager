IntelliJ's default is 140. But in this case we were lucky because it appeared to be possible to set line margin per file type. So Dart plugin sets 80 for Dart files and doesn't touch IDE global default.\r\n\r\nAs for case sensitive completion -  it is not set per file type or per module type. It is global setting. So Flutter plugin must not change the defaults.\r\n\r\nAnd in fact I do not think that there are strong arguments to change the defaults here. We have 16 years of experience and 1,000,000+ of users, and according to own experience, user feedback, and our anonymous statistics most of users are happy with the defaults.\r\n\r\nAnd I myself am very much happy with the defaults. I always know whether I want to write a class name or a method name. So to get smaller completion list I start typing with the correct case. If I have no idea what I want to type and want to see variants I invoke completion without any prefix and get all variants.",
