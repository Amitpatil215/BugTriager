    "body": "Currently, the widget tree is separated by it's class type, which means if we want to update a value for a widget (e.g. style), we must to traverse many nodes to find the custom widgets to see the definition in the build function block. \r\nso if there is a way that show build block for a bunch of sub tree nodes, it would be very useful to trace back to the code definition. \r\n\r\nfor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass C {\r\n  ...\r\n  @override\r\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\r\n    return L1(\r\n      child: L2(\r\n        child: L3(\r\n          child: L4(Colors.black)\r\n        )\r\n      ) \r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe widget tree will show\r\nC -> L1 -> L2 -> L3 -> .. lots of child widgets in L3 -> L4 -> .., which L1-L4 are Flutter widgets. We need to find the C to change the value of L1-L4. The idea is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nC -> C[L1 -> L2 -> L3 -> .. lots of child widgets in L3 -> L4 -> ..]\r\n```\r\nso tracking will become easier.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother case is, our designer will use inspector to quickly find the definition of styling and change it, which works very efficiently in our validation process in website design.",
