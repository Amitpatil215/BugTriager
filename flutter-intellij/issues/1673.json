I'm not 100% sure the project is set up correctly. It pretty much only worked properly the first time I created it and then IntelliJ just forgot all the Android/Flutter settings and it hasn't really worked properly since. The module/SDK/etc. configuration stuff is not very robust at all.\r\n\r\nIn fact, I removed the references to `shared_preferences` from my code and from the yaml file, and I *still* get the same error. That is very weird. Is there no way to do something like a `make clean`?\r\n\r\n## Version info\r\n\r\n```\r\n[✓] Flutter (on Mac OS X 10.13.2 17C88, locale en-GB, channel alpha)\r\n    • Flutter at /Users/shot/Tim/flutter\r\n    • Framework revision 8f65fec5f5 (7 weeks ago), 2017-12-12 09:50:14 -0800\r\n    • Engine revision edaecdc8b8\r\n    • Tools Dart version 1.25.0-dev.11.0\r\n    • Engine Dart version 2.0.0-edge.d8ae797298c3a6cf8dc9f4558707bd2672224d3e\r\n\r\n[✓] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK 27.0.3)\r\n    • Android SDK at /Users/shot/Library/Android/sdk\r\n    • Android NDK location not configured (optional; useful for native profiling support)\r\n    • Platform android-27, build-tools 27.0.3\r\n    • Java binary at: /Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jre/jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_152-release-915-b08)\r\n\r\n[-] iOS toolchain - develop for iOS devices\r\n    ✗ Xcode installation is incomplete; a full installation is necessary for iOS development.\r\n      Download at: https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download/\r\n      Or install Xcode via the App Store.\r\n      Once installed, run:\r\n        sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer\r\n    ✗ libimobiledevice and ideviceinstaller are not installed.

Ugh.\r\n\r\nAnyway the simplest way around this is just to use `shared_preferences` 0.2.5 (not 0.2.6; that doesn't seem to have been released). (And them `rm .flutter_plugins`, because... why would that be fixed automatically? /s)\r\n\r\n(Sorry for sarcasm; I just was expecting this to be a lot less buggy)",
