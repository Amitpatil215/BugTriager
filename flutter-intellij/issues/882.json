    "body": "The SDK run config asks for the file containing main() and also asks for a working directory.\r\n\r\nBut usually you can find the Flutter application's directory by looking for 'lib' in the ancestors of the main file. (You don't even need the pubspec.yaml file, though we look for that too.) I suppose main.dart could be outside lib but still within a directory containing pubspec.yaml, though that seems rare too.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering if we should just drop the working directory field altogether and require that main.dart either live within a \"lib\" directory, or live above a pubspec.yaml file. Is there any reason the user would need to override this?\r\n\r\nRationale: one less thing for the user to think about, and one less corner case to handle in the code.",
