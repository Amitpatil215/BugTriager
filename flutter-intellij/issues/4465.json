    "body": "Hello Flutter team, \r\nI am new to flutter and learning about it. \r\n\r\n**Problem:** I am looking for a way to play a freewheel ad on top of my video. There is no Freewheel flutter package available right now.\r\n\r\n**Complexity:** I can create a freewheel plugin in native Android but the problem here is it needs a `FrameLayout` on to which it can render the ads. So when ads are supposed to be played, we pause the video playback and give the surface real estate to Freewheel to render ads. Native Freewheel library does require the app to pass `FrameLayout` and `Activity`. \r\n\r\nSo is there a concept of partial UI builder in Flutter? What I mean by that is, suppose the video player covers 40% of my screen layout in height. So I can create this portion in native Android but other components on my screen like next video, video playlist, etc I create in Flutter. \r\n\r\nAlso, how would I be able to pass the `Activity` instance to `Freewheel` library?\r\n\r\nLooking for a response.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n## Version info\r\n\r\n```\r\n[✓] Flutter (Channel stable, v1.12.13+hotfix.8, on Mac OS X 10.15.3 19D76, locale en-CA)\r\n    • Flutter version 1.12.13+hotfix.8 at /Users/asharma/Library/flutter\r\n    • Framework revision 0b8abb4724 (7 weeks ago), 2020-02-11 11:44:36 -0800\r\n    • Engine revision e1e6ced81d\r\n    • Dart version 2.7.0\r\n\r\n[!] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 29.0.2)\r\n    • Android SDK at /Users/asharma/Library/Android/sdk\r\n    • Android NDK location not configured (optional; useful for native profiling support)\r\n    • Platform android-29, build-tools 29.0.2\r\n    • ANDROID_HOME = /Users/asharma/Library/Android/sdk\r\n    • Java binary at: /Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jre/jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_202-release-1483-b49-5587405)\r\n    !
