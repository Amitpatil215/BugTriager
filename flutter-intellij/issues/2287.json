Can Flutter widgets have getters that just combine values of input fields, and are used outside of the Widget/State, by other widgets?\r\n\r\nWe could either try to move everything that can be moved, or we could trace what is transitively used from `build()` and can be moved.\r\n\r\nFor example, we could wither move `area`, or keep it in the widget.

But if we take your specific example, I would definitely move `area` to the State Object.\r\n\r\nIn Flutter, Widgets are immutable, temporary Objects that are composed with constructors.  Therefore, mutation methods will never be called on a Widget, and query methods generally only make sense when they're used directly or transitively from the `build()` method, which is in the State Object of a StatefulWidget.  So I'd say move everything possible to the State Object without breaking the build.  Constructor arguments to the Widget can remain, the rest should probably go.\r\n\r\nI'll solicit other Flutter team members to check this out and offer insights if they have any.",

Most values that are calculated on demand are either done in `build` or calculated on specific life cycle events which a stateless widget won't have.\r\n- setters hopefully don't exist.\r\n- methods are often used to split up the `build` method, so having them close to the `build` method is preferable.\r\n\r\n",

Are you worried about hot-reload (something that occurs when values change), or immutable members?\r\n\r\nIn your example, I would opt to place `_biggerFont` in the State Object because I tend to treat the Widget as a public API.  It's the stuff that I want a caller to be aware of and use.  Everything else I push below the public surface into the State Object.  There may be cases that go either way, but I have to imagine that the majority of the time anything that's not a constructor parameter to the Widget should exist in the State instead.  And we should enable the common case here, right?",

So in the example I provided above, I guess a better way to declare _biggerFont would be `static const TextStyle _biggerFont = new TextStyle(fontSize: 18.0);` Then modifying the value of fontSize will be reloadable when it's a member of the State class. \r\n\r\nNonetheless, I suspect many immutable members are declared using `final` instead of `const` in reality. The example I provided actually came from our own [codelab](https://flutter.io/get-started/codelab/#step-4-create-an-infinite-scrolling-listview). Maybe we can add a lint to warn the user? ",
