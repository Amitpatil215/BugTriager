Everything was fine. I did notice one difference. After doing `flutter clean` my editor was marked up with errors. In your video, I did not see that happen. That suggests the analyzer may have been  disconnected. Could you attach a screen shot of the Dart Analysis tool window content after doing `flutter clean` but before the final command?\r\n\r\nAlso, after running the final command (when your editor is lifeless) does restarting the Dart analysis server restore editor functionality? In the Dart Analysis tool window, it is the red circular arrows button at the top of the tool bar on the left side.",
