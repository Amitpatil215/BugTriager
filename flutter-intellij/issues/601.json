How does this happen? It appears that IDEA already implements a similar workaround for Macs.\r\n\r\nIn the GeneralCommandLine class, there is a myParentEnvironmentType field which is set to ParentEnvironmentType.CONSOLE by default.  When this is set, EnvironmentUtil.getEnvironmentMap() gets run. The ShellEnvReader class calls a helper script, which is at  /Applications/IntelliJ\\ IDEA\\ CE.app/Contents/bin/printenv.py on my Mac.\r\n\r\nAs long as we use GeneralCommandLine everywhere, and don't change the default, I think the environment should be set up correctly. If not, I need to figure out what our workaround code should do that IDEA's workaround code doesn't already do.\r\n",
