I would really like us to get to a point where we could make a reasonable guess that hot reload would have 'done what the user wanted', this video is a clear example of that. \r\n\r\nHow difficult would it be to get analytics data that the changes could have been hot reloaded, but we instead were instructed to do a restart? Even if the metric has some false negatives it would be nice to get a sense of whether this is a major problem or not.\r\n\r\nGiven that this is such a key UX, I would support adding a feedback mechanism that said if the user had done say 5 repeated restarts in a row with relatively little time between them we print a url to the console asking them to tell us if they knew of hot reload, and if so why it is that reload isn't working for them.\r\n",
