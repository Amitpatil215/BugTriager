Today I try to update my app and while trying to test on my iPhone 6 and iPhone X, I can't see my iOS device in IntelliJ. I run my app on iOS simulator and it was okay. Then I open the Xcode and run my app from there using my connected iPhone 6 and iPhone X. Its install my app on device with white screen. Than I kill my app and tab an run again an my app opens and works on my iOS device.\r\n\r\nWhen will we can get a same option before that I can see my connected iOS device on IntelliJ?
