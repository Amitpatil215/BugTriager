It would be nice if we also have ability to use multiple Flutter SDK and configure SDK for project, not the whole IDE.\r\n\r\nThat the case: I have old project with previous Flutter version (can't be upgraded) and the new one - with the latest version. During development I need to switches between two project, but they have different version of Flutter, so I need to change SDK path (or call `flutter version {version}` manually every time.",
