It will be so much nicer if we can see `int?` there. \r\n\r\n**Flutter doctor:** \r\n```\r\n[✓] Flutter (Channel dev, 1.21.0-7.0.pre, on Mac OS X 10.15.1 19B88, locale en-GB)\r\n[✓] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 29.0.3)\r\n[✓] Xcode - develop for iOS and macOS (Xcode 11.2.1)\r\n[✓] Chrome - develop for the web\r\n[✓] Android Studio (version 4.0)\r\n[✓] VS Code (version 1.45.1)\r\n```",
