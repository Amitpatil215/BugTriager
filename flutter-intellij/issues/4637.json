Normal element mounting (7 frames)\r\n#10     Element.inflateWidget (package:flutter/src/widgets/framework.dart:3446:14)\r\n#11     Element.updateChild (package:flutter/src/widgets/framework.dart:3211:20)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nEverytime I see the file \"framework.dart\" in the logs I know I am in serious trouble... A better stacktrace should include the files and lines that the execution take place. The only file and line that is shown in the log belong to a parent widget that is not causing the error.\r\n\r\nAlso, the logs in the run tab are becoming a lot polluted... It is hard to find anything relevant among so many messages.\r\n\r\nWhy the logcat tab always show the message \"Please configure Android SDK\"? The SDK is already configured. The logcat sometimes work, but mostly of time it doesn't.\r\n\r\nSometimes, when the IDE marks some code with a red line, when I try to see what is by placing the mouse cursor above it, it display a message VERY FAST and I can't read what is there...  :-(\r\n",
