I've tried previous versions of both and still have the same issue.\r\n\r\nBasically I'm wanting to do the Android X migration for our Flutter app in order to use the latest plugins, and I was having the issues detailed here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54395491/unable-to-migrate-to-androidx/54618207 I then go to open just the android module in Android Studio rather than the whole project, and find that the `Flutter` option when right clicking is greyed out. To note when I do the same on the root project folder or the ios module, I get the option `Open iOS module in Xcode` under the non-greyed out Flutter menu item.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"581\" alt=\"screenshot 2019-03-02 at 20 51 31\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17346045/53688778-f474b000-3d40-11e9-9135-a20ef8e1b5c4.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"689\" alt=\"screenshot 2019-03-02 at 09 38 15\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17346045/53688781-fa6a9100-3d40-11e9-95a7-58862329bd14.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n## Logs\r\n\r\nflutter doctor output:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[✓] Flutter (Channel stable, v1.2.1, on Mac OS X 10.14 18A391, locale en-GB)\r\n    • Flutter version 1.2.1 at /Users/niamhpower/development/flutter\r\n    • Framework revision 8661d8aecd (2 weeks ago), 2019-02-14 19:19:53 -0800\r\n    • Engine revision 3757390fa4\r\n    • Dart version 2.1.2 (build 2.1.2-dev.0.0 0a7dcf17eb)\r\n\r\n[✓] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 28.0.3)\r\n    • Android SDK at /Users/niamhpower/Library/Android/sdk\r\n    • Android NDK location not configured (optional; useful for native profiling support)\r\n    • Platform android-28, build-tools 28.0.3\r\n    • ANDROID_HOME = /Users/niamhpower/Library/Android/sdk\r\n    • Java binary at: /Applications/Android Studio 3.4 Preview.app/Contents/jre/jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_152-release-1248-b22)\r\n    • All Android licenses accepted.\r\n\r\n[✓] iOS toolchain - develop for iOS devices (Xcode 10.2)\r\n    • Xcode at /Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer\r\n    • Xcode 10.2, Build version 10P99q\r\n    • ios-deploy 1.9.4\r\n    • CocoaPods version 1.6.0.beta.2\r\n\r\n[✓] Android Studio\r\n    • Android Studio at /Applications/Android Studio 3.4 Preview.app/Contents\r\n    • Flutter plugin version 33.3.2\r\n    • Dart plugin version 183.5901\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_152-release-1248-b22)\r\n\r\n[✓] IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition (version 2018.2.5)\r\n    • IntelliJ at /Applications/IntelliJ IDEA CE.app\r\n    • Flutter plugin version 31.3.3\r\n    • Dart plugin version 182.5215\r\n\r\n[!] VS Code (version 1.30.2)\r\n    • VS Code at /Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents\r\n    ✗ Flutter extension not installed; install from\r\n      https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.flutter\r\n\r\n[✓] Connected device (1 available)\r\n    • Android SDK built for x86 • emulator-5554 • android-x86 • Android 9 (API 28) (emulator)\r\n\r\n!

            "body": "@Rostanxd   thank you mate, it helped me, but for other ppl I want to warn to be careful with project root name, I mean if your project root name separated with '-' , then before deleting the module you should change your project root name to be with underlines '_'. In my case it was this way, 1. I changed the module name. 2. I changed the project root folder name and only after this steps I could do the steps that @Rostanxd  said, if you will delete the module and start to add a new one by mentioning your project folder, which name with '-' , dart wont allow you to add such name, and you will need to close that window and go to change the project root name, but you allready deleted the module :) , this bringing many issues, that why I'm suggesting, before deleting the module be sure that everything is ok with project root name",
