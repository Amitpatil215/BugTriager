After doing that both warnings went away - so it's possible that this is really a bug for the Dart Plugin to IntelliJ rather than the Flutter plugin.\r\nHowever, the 'where is the SDK' conceptual problem still occurs.\r\n\r\nSorry for the misfiling, is there somewhere you would like me to move this to?
