The percent icon appeared in my sample project. BTW, `Icons.percent` is a material icon, not the pub package you mentioned.\r\n\r\nI suspect the problem with icon previews disappearing in the editor is due to the font file format used in Flutter 3.0 for material icons. I'm looking into that. Some appear, others do not, which suggests to me that Java 11 isn't able to process all the icons.",
