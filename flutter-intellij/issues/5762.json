What happens when you try to run your app from a terminal? If you get the same error you will get better support by creating an issue here: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues\r\n\r\nIf `flutter run` works then we need to dig deeper. Turn on verbose logging in the Flutter settings page, try to run your app, then find the log file and attach it here.\r\n\r\nThis could also happen if you are running another app in a debugger on the same device. Restarting the device will clear any other connections. You can also try using an Android emulator.",
