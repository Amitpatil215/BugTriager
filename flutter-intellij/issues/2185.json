Can I profile this or not? :)\r\n\r\nAlso, when I select the \"Profile...\" menu item, I get the little persistent popup menu which includes \"Run\", but when I click that, it does a debug run, not a profile run.\r\n\r\nMy suspicion is that multiple plugins are fighting here over the term \"Profile\" (Dart and Flutter?), and that the \"Run\" is overloaded to run Flutter, but it's super confusing for the user.  Is there any way that:\r\n\r\n1. A Flutter app can \"win\" this fight and put an enabled profile button on the toolbar, replacing the existing disabled one?\r\n2. Or, At least add one that is enabled (and runs \"flutter run\" in profile mode) so that I have something up there by default?\r\n\r\n## Version info\r\n```\r\n[✓] Flutter (Channel chip_perf, v0.3.6-pre.30, on Mac OS X 10.13.3 17D102, locale en-US)\r\n    • Flutter version 0.3.6-pre.30 at /Users/gspencer/code/flutter\r\n    • Framework revision 5beb182ad1 (9 hours ago), 2018-05-01 08:22:29 -0700\r\n    • Engine revision 613aae032f\r\n    • Dart version 2.0.0-dev.50.0.flutter-cd0c4e4fe1\r\n\r\n[✓] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK 26.0.2)\r\n    • Android SDK at /Users/gspencer/Library/Android/sdk\r\n    • Android NDK at /Users/gspencer/Library/Android/sdk/ndk-bundle\r\n    • Platform android-27, build-tools 26.0.2\r\n    • ANDROID_HOME = /Users/gspencer/Library/Android/sdk\r\n    • Java binary at: /Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jre/jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_152-release-915-b08)\r\n    • All Android licenses accepted.\r\n\r\n[✓] iOS toolchain - develop for iOS devices (Xcode 9.2)\r\n    • Xcode at /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer\r\n    • Xcode 9.2, Build version 9C40b\r\n    • ios-deploy 1.9.2\r\n    • CocoaPods version 1.4.0\r\n\r\n[✓] Android Studio (version 3.0)\r\n    • Android Studio at /Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents\r\n    ✗ Flutter plugin not installed; this adds Flutter specific functionality.\r\n    • Dart plugin version 162.2924\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_152-release-915-b08)\r\n\r\n[✓] IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition (version 2018.1.1)\r\n    • IntelliJ at /Applications/IntelliJ IDEA CE.app\r\n    • Flutter plugin version 23.2.3\r\n    • Dart plugin version 181.4445.29\r\n\r\n[✓] Connected devices (1 available)\r\n    • Pixel 2 • FA81A1A02109 • android-arm64 • Android 8.1.0 (API 27)\r\n\r\n• No issues found!\r\n```\r\n",
