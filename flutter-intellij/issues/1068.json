    "body": "We have had a number of issues recently where flutter builds on both android and ios slowed down due to several \"environment\" issues (e.g., gradle setup, network throttling, Pod install). When running in the terminal it's somewhat clear where the slowdown is, and that nothing is \"hung\" as you get a progress spinner. In IntelliJ it's harder as 1) there is little terminal feedback, and 2) you may miss the progress indicator in the IJ window chrome.\r\n\r\nI'd like to propose we simply print the same status to the IJ terminal that `flutter run` / `flutter build` prints to the terminal (incl. the `/` spinner for indeterminate progress).",

Sounds like the progress bar is harder to notice. I'm of two minds about adding a text spinner, since that seems appropriate for a CLI, but low-fidelity for an IDE (w/ existing progress conventions).\r\n",
