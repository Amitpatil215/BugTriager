Also, saved the l10n.yaml file in lib.\r\n> \r\n> However, it stilll shows error, may be because i am starter and messed up, Can someone tell me which package has to be installed exactly and process? **PLEASE!**\r\n> \r\n> I am self-learning and don't know what to do!!\r\n> \r\n> **Thankyou for viewing my comment!**\r\n\r\n@Sushma-Shrestha, I did what @stevemessick commented about the [Flutter localization docs](https://github.com/flutter/flutter-intellij/issues/5819#issuecomment-942607125) (specially after step 5) and worked; you need to run the project in order to generate the files mentioned in step 6 (if your IDE asks/warns about errors run it anyway).",
