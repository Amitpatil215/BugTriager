This probably occurred because I have my flutter SDK installed in the E:\\ directory rather than default C:\\ directory.\r\nThis is how I solved it, \r\n1: Check where your Flutter Sdk is present. You can do this by creating a \"New project->Flutter->Flutter Sdk\" (This works if you have the flutter Sdk installed and configured, If you don't have it installed you can click on install Sdk option in the same \"new Project->Flutter\" window).\r\n2:  Then open Terminal by going to bottom right corner of you IDE and then clicking on terminal.\r\n3: Change your directory to the flutter sdk's bin location by Typing \"cd _yourSdkLocation\\bin\". Here replace \"_yourSdkLocation\" with the directory address where your flutter Sdk is present.\r\n4: Then run \"flutter upgrade --force\" \r\n\r\nHope this Helps. :)",
