It seems ambiguous to me whether `new_project` is going to be created as a subdirectory or if the plugin is assuming that `tests` is the directory I've already made to contain my project. Since I'm making a new project, I would expect that the directory is going to be made for me.\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-04-20 at 10 45 01 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6379305/164291178-f4864955-5370-4b99-b2a7-ff0db2ac7b46.png)\r\n\r\nDefault (non-Flutter) new project shows a line below of where the project will go:\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-04-20 at 10 48 48 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6379305/164291773-533c1caa-446a-4d16-9468-589e70d1fd13.png)\r\n\r\n",
