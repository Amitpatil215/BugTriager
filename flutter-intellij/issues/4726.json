Both are not working.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Version info\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n[√] Flutter (Channel stable, v1.17.5, on Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.18363.959], locale en-DE)\r\n    • Flutter version 1.17.5 at D:\\dev\\flutter\\sdk\r\n    • Framework revision 8af6b2f038 (4 weeks ago), 2020-06-30 12:53:55 -0700\r\n    • Engine revision ee76268252\r\n    • Dart version 2.8.4\r\n\r\n[!] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 29.0.3)\r\n    • Android SDK at C:\\Users\\User\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\sdk\r\n    • Platform android-29, build-tools 29.0.3\r\n    • Java binary at: C:\\Program Files\\Android\\Android Studio\\jre\\bin\\java\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_242-release-1644-b01)\r\n    X Android license status unknown.\r\n      Try re-installing or updating your Android SDK Manager.\r\n      See https://developer.android.com/studio/#downloads or visit visit https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/windows#android-setup for detailed instructions.\r\n\r\n[√] Android Studio (version 4.0)\r\n    • Android Studio at C:\\Program Files\\Android\\Android Studio\r\n    • Flutter plugin version 47.1.2\r\n    • Dart plugin version 193.7361\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_242-release-1644-b01)\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n",
