If you open a file before it returns, I'd expect to see this.  --- An easy fix is to queue up the nature assignment before we do the wait.  I'll look at that.\n2. Besides that there's a larger issue of whether we should be calling `flutter create` for a project created from sources _in the first place_.  The trouble is, you _might_ so I'd hate to just turn it off in case, for example, the target directory exists.  Maybe we should provide a checkbox in the project wizard?  (Something like \"Create sample Flutter App content\"?)\n\nAll of this is just a reminder that we really want to flesh out the \"create a project from source\" flow...  \n\ncc @mit-mit \n",
