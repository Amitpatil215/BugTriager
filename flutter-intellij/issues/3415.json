This does mean that there are a lot more symbols to show. In the case where you're not typing `new`, I think you're seeing both the type name (`MaterialApp`) and the constructor for that class (`MaterialApp()`).\r\n\r\n@lambdabaa, I believe that a not-yet-in-stable iteration will show additional details in the code completion view?\r\n\r\n",

We do have a couple of changes in the works to improve this situation.\r\n\r\nThe first one was https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-plugins/pull/650 which makes it so that we always show the exporting library even if there are parameters (for example, in the case of a constructor). I will check to see which 2019.1 Dart plugin versions, if any, includes this change.\r\n\r\nA second improvement was made in analysis server last week https://dart-review.googlesource.com/c/sdk/+/103561 to tell the IntelliJ plugin\r\n\r\n1. which libraries are already imported in a file and also\r\n2. which library each suggestion originates from.\r\n\r\nI am working on a Dart IntelliJ plugin patch this week to use those bits so that, if a library that exports a token is already imported, we will filter not-yet-imported completion suggestions for that token.\r\n\r\nWe don't have a plan yet for the more general option to prevent duplicate suggestions altogether, but perhaps this could be implemented as an opt-in Dart IntelliJ preference.

This way we'll have only one item for each class. Note that I'm not an experienced Dart developer, so I'm not sure if it's possible to find \"the best import\" and how important is the feature to show all available paths to the same class. But I understand and confirm that seeing the same class several times is confusing, especially for beginners.\r\n\r\nRegarding the second problem: \"Both class and constructor are suggested\". Such two items look very similar and effectively the difference is only in parentheses insertion. Again, I'm not a pro Dart dev, but I'd be happy if the server could decide which suggestion is better and give only one of those.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I'd be happy not to add any options to the IDE UI.",

In the case where no already-imported libraries export a name but multiple, not-yet-imported libraries export it, we have this issue regardless.\r\n\r\nThe client preference would say \"never suggest the duplicate names / displayUris\" or similar.
