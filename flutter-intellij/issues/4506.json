    "body": "I'm writing a plugin for a [custom embedder](https://github.com/go-flutter-desktop/go-flutter) and I need the flutter plugin to attach to my running flutter app. I get the observatory URI and all necessary parameters to generate a command line attach (`sdkFields.createFlutterSdkAttachCommand`: `/home/jld3103/flutter/bin/flutter --no-color attach --machine --device-id=flutter-tester --debug-uri=http://127.0.0.1:50300/ lib/main_desktop.dart`). \r\n That command works when I run it in the console.  \r\nIn the plugin I use some code derived from [this](https://github.com/flutter/flutter-intellij/blob/f429dea3134a4f046776ac796c2c75641b1f938a/src/io/flutter/actions/AttachDebuggerAction.java#L82-L117).\r\nIt gives me a dialog saying that no device was found.\r\n\r\nSo my question is how to attach the flutter plugin from another plugin to a flutter app running a custom embedder?",
