It looks like the widget tree caches the all widgets in the \"page stack\".\r\n\r\nExample: My application has two pages, one is the main page, another one is a child page which I can jump to via clicking a button on the main page. And on the child page, I can return back to main page by clicking the navigation back button on the AppBar.\r\n\r\nWhen I launch the app and open the main page, the widget tree displays the widgets defined for main page.  When I jumps to the child page and clicks the \"Refresh Widget Info\", the widget tree shows widgets defined for both main page and child page.   And I want the widget tree to be truly real-time, without caching the widgets of last pages from where I could navigate to current page.\r\n\r\nThanks",
