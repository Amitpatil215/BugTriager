Since the `*.iml` files are not checked in you will have to re-designate all source directories before any indexing can occur.

I'm not sure what effect eliminating `.vscode` will have.\r\n\r\nThe existence of `android_fullscreen/.gitignore` is confusing. It looks like specific files in `.idea` are meant to be ignored, but there's no `.idea `in the repo, probably due to the rule in the root `.gitignore`.\r\n\r\nIIRC when we import a module we have to change something in its `.android`. So having `.android` in `flutter_module/.gitignore` is probably going to break it.\r\n\r\nFor the plugin sources we include specific files in `.idea` that should be ignored in [our .gitignore](https://github.com/flutter/flutter-intellij/blob/master/.gitignore).

I suppose what this means is that if the user followed the manual integration steps in https://flutter.dev/docs/development/add-to-app/android/project-setup#manual-integration, they need to retrace the module import wizard flow in the IDE to get co-editing. Is that right? In that case, we could add some more hints to https://flutter.dev/docs/development/add-to-app/android/project-setup. \r\n\r\nThis might also be a question for @RedBrogdon. Should the default samples have the various intellij metadata checked-in? So someone can just clone the repo, AS open the host project and see both projects.",
