If you run Android Studio at full screen width (on a HD monitor) the link is just visible enough to click it. If you run Android Studio at a narrower width - in order to see the emulator at the same time - the link is obscured.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nCreate a new Flutter project and run your Android Studio instance at half to two-thirds screen width. Add a BottomNavigationBar. Try and click through to the definition of BottomNavigationBar using Ctrl+click and you'll find it's obscured by the tootltip.\r\n\r\nThis is on Ubuntu and Android Studio 3.5 and IntelliJ plugin versions 39.0.3 (Flutter) and v191.8423 (Dart)\r\n\r\nThe below links show an example of the Widget link being obscured.\r\n\r\nBefore\r\nhttps://imgur.com/0oilQ6W\r\n\r\nAfter (when trying to Ctrl+Click)\r\nhttps://imgur.com/ljKBdMV\r\n\r\n## Version info\r\n\r\n[✓] Flutter (Channel beta, v1.9.1+hotfix.2, on Linux, locale en_GB.UTF-8)\r\n    • Flutter version 1.9.1+hotfix.2 at /home/ben/Development/flutter\r\n    • Framework revision 2d2a1ffec9 (13 days ago), 2019-09-06 18:39:49 -0700\r\n    • Engine revision b863200c37\r\n    • Dart version 2.5.0\r\n\r\n[!] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 29.0.2)\r\n    • Android SDK at /media/ubuntudata/Development/android/sdk\r\n    • Android NDK location not configured (optional; useful for native profiling support)\r\n    • Platform android-29, build-tools 29.0.2\r\n    • Java binary at: /home/ben/Development/android/android-studio/jre/bin/java\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_202-release-1483-b49-5587405)\r\n    ✗ Android license status unknown.\r\n      Try re-installing or updating your Android SDK Manager.\r\n      See https://developer.android.com/studio/#downloads or visit https://flutter.dev/setup/#android-setup for detailed\r\n      instructions.\r\n\r\n[✓] Android Studio (version 3.5)\r\n    • Android Studio at /home/ben/Development/android/android-studio\r\n    • Flutter plugin version 39.0.3\r\n    • Dart plugin version 191.8423\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_202-release-1483-b49-5587405)\r\n\r\n[✓] IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition (version 2019.2)\r\n    • IntelliJ at /home/ben/Development/idea-IC\r\n    • Flutter plugin version 38.2.4\r\n    • Dart plugin version 192.6459\r\n\r\n[✓] VS Code (version 1.38.1)\r\n    • VS Code at /usr/share/code\r\n    • Flutter extension version 3.4.1\r\n\r\n[!] Connected device\r\n    !

            "body": "Thanks for the detailed report. I wish I had a better answer for you than I do.\r\n\r\nOn my Mac the tooltips show up when I move the mouse while holding the Cmd key down. They don't show if the key is up. I don't know if it works the same way on Linux but if it does the easiest work-around is to press the Ctrl key when clicking the mouse button.\r\n\r\nIf that doesn't solve the problem you can try reporting this to the Dart plugin devs at youtrack.jetbrains.com. I suspect that this is something controlled by the IntelliJ editor and may be difficult to get fixed.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the issue really is just the size of the tooltip text then perhaps that can be reduced. It looks like it is already being trimmed somewhat so maybe just reducing the size more would work. @alexander-doroshko is this controlled by the Dart plugin?",
