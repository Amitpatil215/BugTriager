Yes, the main.dart file was complaining that the dart SDK was not configured and gave the option to Download Dart SDK or Open Dart Settings. I tried both and eventually was able to download Dart SDK and put the path in the Dart settings. But after doing that the iOS and Android Simulator drop down menu disappeared! The Select Device drop down menu wasn't there anymore and the \"Run\" button was greyed out. The solution was to update the Flutter SDK Path (Android Studio --> Preferences --> Languages --> Flutter) was pointing to the Flutter installation folder. Once I applied that and removed the Dart SDK path it auto populated the Dart SDK path to the Flutter install Dart folder. ",
