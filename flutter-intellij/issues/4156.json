When the Flutter module is first added to an Android app an error is generated because Gradle does not recognize the module. That issue gets fixed and the error is no longer applicable, but the balloon still looks scary.\r\n\r\nWhen the project is re-opened with a Fluter file open in the editor we see a banner claiming Dart support is not enabled. The banner disappears within a few seconds, after our Gradle sync listener fires. We should work with @alexander-doroshko to find a way to prevent the banner from being displayed.\r\n\r\nThese issues are minor and should not delay the M42 release.",
