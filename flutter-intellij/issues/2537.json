It reloaded either on dart project files, or whether there was an actual change to a file. What we found was that it was difficult to reason for the user about when a save would reload, and the mental model they formed was more that cmd-S was the keybinding for reload.\r\n\r\nThis is currently working as intended, but we're definitely happy to get feedback about how well its working, or ideas for improvements.",

            "body": "FWIW, in VS Code we hook the save event for hot reload (which means if VS Code decides there's nothing to save, it won't trigger, even if you're hitting the Save shortcut key). Then we check:\r\n\r\n- `flutterHotReloadOnSave` is enabled\r\n- The file is in the an open workspace folder\r\n- The file extension of the save is `.dart`\r\n- There are no diagnostics of type `Error` in the problems list for that file\r\n\r\nIf we get past all that, we set a 200ms timer to reload (and reset that 200ms timer if additional events come through - this is basically to stop multiple hot-reloads if the user hits Save All with multiple dirty files).\r\n\r\nIt might make sense to align these, though I'm not sure if I could reliably catch the Save short-cut key in a way that would fire when there are no changes (we could bind to Cmd+S, but the user can re-bind this or save using the file menu, etc.).",
