Install VSCode Keymap plugin (https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12062-vscode-keymap)\r\n4. Change Keymap to VSCode (File -> Settings -> Keymap -> Choose VS Code from select box, then Apply)\r\n5. Make changes to code and verify that hot reload not longer works upon save (manually clicking hot reload button will still work)\r\n6. Change Keymap back to Windows (File -> Settings -> Keymap -> Choose Windows from select box, then Apply)\r\n7. Make changes to code and verify hot reload works again upon file save\r\n\r\n## Version info\r\n\r\n    • Flutter version 3.0.1 at C:\\Users\\ablon\\opt\\flutter_windows_2.10.3-stable\\flutter\r\n    • Upstream repository https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git\r\n    • Framework revision fb57da5f94 (4 months ago), 2022-05-19 15:50:29 -0700\r\n    • Engine revision caaafc5604\r\n    • Dart version 2.17.1\r\n    • DevTools version 2.12.2\r\n\r\nAndroid Studio Chipmunk | 2021.2.1 Patch 2\r\non Windows 11\r\n",

In the standard keymap, Cmd-S (your Crtl-S) is bound to \"Save All\". In the VS Code keymap (for Windows), Crtl-S is bound to \"Save\" -- that is, save a single file. Hot Reload is triggered by a \"Save All\" action. The equivalent keystroke in the VS Code keymap is a two-stroke sequence: Ctrl-K, S.\r\n\r\nDoes Ctrl-K, S trigger hot reload?",
