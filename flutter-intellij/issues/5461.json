I'm using the `FlutterSdk.flutterRun` method to run the opened project and everything works fine. However I noticed that when I run on a device (Android, web or MacOS) in debug mode, the app is started in paused mode: it builds the app on the device, but I get a blank app (the Flutter UI is not rendered).\r\n\r\nAfter some investigation I notice that the method I'm using is adding the `--start-paused` option automatically:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/flutter/flutter-intellij/blob/f21250eaedeed48397c24cddef7d30c75ad19db1/src/io/flutter/sdk/FlutterSdk.java#L277-L279\r\n\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nProvide a way to prevent this flag of being passed automatically.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Version info\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>flutter run -v</summary>\r\n\r\n```console\r\n[âœ“] Flutter (Channel stable, 2.0.6, on macOS 11.2.3 20D91 darwin-x64, locale en-AO)\r\n    â€¢ Flutter version 2.0.6 at /Users/pedromassango/Code/flutter_stable\r\n    â€¢ Framework revision 1d9032c7e1 (5 days ago), 2021-04-29 17:37:58 -0700\r\n    â€¢ Engine revision 05e680e202\r\n    â€¢ Dart version 2.12.3\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 30.0.2)\r\n    â€¢ Android SDK at /Users/pedromassango/Library/Android/sdk\r\n    â€¢ Platform android-30, build-tools 30.0.2\r\n    â€¢ ANDROID_HOME = /Users/pedromassango/Library/Android/sdk\r\n    â€¢ Java binary at: /Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jre/jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java\r\n    â€¢ Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_242-release-1644-b3-6915495)\r\n    â€¢ All Android licenses accepted.\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Xcode - develop for iOS and macOS\r\n    â€¢ Xcode at /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer\r\n    â€¢ Xcode 12.4, Build version 12D4e\r\n    â€¢ CocoaPods version 1.10.1\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Chrome - develop for the web\r\n    â€¢ Chrome at /Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Android Studio (version 4.1)\r\n    â€¢ Android Studio at /Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents\r\n    â€¢ Flutter plugin can be installed from:\r\n      ðŸ”¨ https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9212-flutter\r\n    â€¢ Dart plugin can be installed from:\r\n      ðŸ”¨ https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6351-dart\r\n    â€¢ Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_242-release-1644-b3-6915495)\r\n\r\n[âœ“] IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition (version 2021.1)\r\n    â€¢ IntelliJ at /Applications/IntelliJ IDEA CE.app\r\n    â€¢ Flutter plugin version 55.1.5\r\n    â€¢ Dart plugin version 211.7179\r\n\r\n[âœ“] VS Code (version 1.55.2)\r\n    â€¢ VS Code at /Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents\r\n    â€¢ Flutter extension version 3.16.0\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Connected device (3 available)\r\n    â€¢ Redmi 5 Plus (mobile) â€¢ 0258ff700005 â€¢ android-arm64  â€¢ Android 8.1.0 (API 27)\r\n    â€¢ macOS (desktop)       â€¢ macos        â€¢ darwin-x64     â€¢ macOS 11.2.3 20D91 darwin-x64\r\n    â€¢ Chrome (web)          â€¢ chrome       â€¢ web-javascript â€¢ Google Chrome 90.0.4430.93\r\n\r\nâ€¢ No issues found!\r\n\r\n```\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n",
