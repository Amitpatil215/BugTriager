    "body": "## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nThe Dart Analyzer always tells me, that I should add the Key parameter to the widget constructor. There is a quick fix refactoring (Project quick fix, Alt+Enter/Option+Enter), for this, that only shows up, if the constructor isn't const.  \r\n\r\n`const SomeWidget({required String this.someParam});`\r\nRefactorings: \r\n* Convert to block body\r\n\r\n`SomeWidget({required String this.someParam});`\r\nRefactorings: \r\n* Add 'const' modifier\r\n* Add 'key' to constructors\r\n* Convert to block body\r\n\r\nIt would be helpful to have the add-key-refactoring also for const constructors. On the other hand, the 'Convert to block body' refactoring makes no sense for const constructors, because const constructors must have no body.\r\n\r\n## Version info\r\n```\r\n[âœ“] Flutter (Channel stable, 2.8.0, on macOS 12.1 21C52 darwin-arm, locale de-DE)\r\n    â€¢ Flutter version 2.8.0\r\n    â€¢ Upstream repository https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git\r\n    â€¢ Framework revision cf44000065 (11 days ago), 2021-12-08 14:06:50 -0800\r\n    â€¢ Engine revision 40a99c5951\r\n    â€¢ Dart version 2.15.0\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 32.0.0)\r\n    â€¢ Platform android-32, build-tools 32.0.0\r\n    â€¢ Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.10+0-b96-7249189)\r\n    â€¢ All Android licenses accepted.\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Android Studio (version 2020.3)\r\n    â€¢ Flutter plugin can be installed from:\r\n      ðŸ”¨ https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9212-flutter\r\n    â€¢ Dart plugin can be installed from:\r\n      ðŸ”¨ https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6351-dart\r\n    â€¢ Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.10+0-b96-7249189)\r\n\r\nThe Dart and Flutter Plugins are installed in Android Studio.
