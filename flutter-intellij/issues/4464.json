    "body": "Thanks for the feedback! If your issue is related to the Flutter framework itself,\r\nplease open an issue at\r\n[github.com/flutter/flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/new).\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n_Please tell us what you were doing and what went wrong_\r\n\r\nThe simplest steps to reproduce seem to be as follow:\r\n\r\n1. Create a project with the Android Studio \"New Flutter Project\" option\r\n2. Commit all files on the project (`git add .` and `git commit`) and push them to a repo (e.g. https://gitlab.com/MateusRodCosta/flutter-test-app)\r\n3. Clone the repo in a new folder\r\n4. Open the new cloned project with Android Studio\r\n5. If the IDE offers you the option, run pub get (note that it didn't make any difference for me)\r\n\r\nExpected result:\r\n\r\n- Correct project metadata (.iml files are actually generated)\r\n- The option to \"Open Android module in Android Studio\" appears on the Flutter sub-menu\r\n- \"Project Structure\" dialog is always accessible\r\n- Some level of autocomplete on Java/Kotlin files (when using root of flutter project) \r\n\r\nActual results:\r\n\r\n- No metadata seems to be actually created\r\n- option to \"Open Android module in Android Studio\" isn't present on the Flutter sub-menu\r\n- \"Project Structure\" option disappears at times\r\n- No autocomplete at all on Kotlin/Java files (when using root of flutter project) \r\n\r\nAs an example, here is what the Project Structure looks on a freshly-created project:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-04-05 15-16-47](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24463334/78506764-4b259800-7752-11ea-9e9a-68f62858406b.png)\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-04-05 15-16-56](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24463334/78506765-4f51b580-7752-11ea-972a-9af56fef3644.png)\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-04-05 15-34-11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24463334/78506856-f5052480-7752-11ea-860d-bed61d12c813.png)\r\n\r\nAnd on the same project after being cloned:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-04-05 15-30-13](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24463334/78506778-6b555700-7752-11ea-8a4c-1c17df576870.png)\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-04-05 15-30-17](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24463334/78506783-6f817480-7752-11ea-9348-a12cb055c16e.png)\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-04-05 15-34-50](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24463334/78506864-03534080-7753-11ea-9cad-3d5bffc75e84.png)\r\n\r\nMetadata should be created but isn't. And there seems to be no way to create it except by doing it manually.\r\n\r\n## Version info\r\n\r\nPlease paste the output of running `flutter doctor -v` here (available from the command\r\nline or from `Tools > Flutter > Flutter Doctor`). It will provide the version of the\r\nFlutter framework as well as of the IntelliJ plugin.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[✓] Flutter (Channel unknown, v1.12.13+hotfix.7, on Linux, locale en_US.utf8)\r\n    • Flutter version 1.12.13+hotfix.7 at /home/mateusrc/flutter\r\n    • Framework revision 9f5ff2306b (2 months ago), 2020-01-26 22:38:26 -0800\r\n    • Engine revision a67792536c\r\n    • Dart version 2.7.0\r\n\r\n[✓] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 29.0.3)\r\n    • Android SDK at /home/mateusrc/Android/Sdk\r\n    • Android NDK location not configured (optional; useful for native profiling\r\n      support)\r\n    • Platform android-29, build-tools 29.0.3\r\n    • ANDROID_HOME = /home/mateusrc/Android/Sdk\r\n    • Java binary at: /home/mateusrc/Android/android-studio/jre/bin/java\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build\r\n      1.8.0_212-release-1586-b4-5784211)\r\n    • All Android licenses accepted.\r\n\r\n[✓] Android Studio (version 3.6)\r\n    • Android Studio at /home/mateusrc/Android/android-studio\r\n    • Flutter plugin version 45.0.1\r\n    • Dart plugin version 192.7761\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build\r\n      1.8.0_212-release-1586-b4-5784211)\r\n\r\n[✓] IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition (version 2019.3)\r\n    • IntelliJ at /home/mateusrc/idea-IC-192.5728.98\r\n    • Flutter plugin version 44.0.3\r\n    • Dart plugin version 193.6911.25\r\n\r\n[✓] Connected device (1 available)\r\n    • moto g 7 • 0055562019 • android-arm64 • Android 9 (API 28)\r\n\r\n• No issues found!\r\n```",
