If I had `flutter run` running before, it was killed by starting the Android Studio with \"Lost connection to device\". In Android Studio, the device is intermittently shown and disappears. It was not possible to run the app from the Studio, saying the devices is not connected. \r\n\r\nIt is as if Android Studio and terminal battle for the `flutter` process and neither of them works correctly when Android Studio is running. Thus I had to choose between running the app, and developing the app in Studio :).\r\n\r\nIt seems it has been solved by running the command @dazza5000 suggested:\r\n`flutter config --android-sdk /path/to/android-sdk`\r\nfrom inside the terminal in Android Studio.\r\n\r\nI don't understand why it works, as `flutter doctor` didn't indicate any problems with Android SDK, I have $ANDROID_HOME and PATH set up correctly, etc. Thank you @dazza5000 !\r\n\r\n",
