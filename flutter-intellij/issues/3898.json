            "body": "I think the name change may have come about due to confusion with the old name (I think it came up in the Dart-Code issue tracker). There's also a comment on the reddit thread linked above:\r\n\r\n> When I hear remove widget it sounds like it should remove the whole subtree at given widget. Then replace should well replace the widget with its children.\r\n\r\nThere are some additional comments here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/FlutterDev/comments/d4l8qt/action_of_remove_widget_is_gone_in_vs_code/\r\n\r\nincluding:\r\n\r\n> 'Remove child' heavily implied that the whole widget would get removed (including it's child/children) but it only replaced the parent with it's child/children, so it made sense to change the name.\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n> Edit: My reasoning is actually wrong here, since all the descendants are also part of that widget. My bad.\r\n\r\nMy interpretation is that maybe neither name is clear. I think if you're looking to remove a widget (but leave it's children) looking for a \"remove widget\" refactor in isolation makes sense. However when you're not in that situation, being presented with \"Remove widget\" is a big ambigious.\r\n\r\nMaybe we could have a name that contains \"Remove widget\" but is less vague (for example something along the line of \"Remove widget (keep child widgets)\" might suit both needs, though could probably be worded better). Having an action to remove the whole sub-tree (\"Remove children (including children)\") might also remove ambiguity?",
