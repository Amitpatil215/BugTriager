If your issue is related to the Flutter framework itself,\r\nplease open an issue at\r\n[github.com/flutter/flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/new).\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nFVM (https://fvm.app) is an excellent app to help associate a specific flutter version with a project.\r\n\r\nHowever, it requires that the user enter an absolute path in the Flutter path in settings. Absolute\r\npaths are not great and hard to share in a multi-developer environment.\r\n\r\nSuggestions\r\nBest: If the IDE sees a \".fvm\" directory in the top level of the project, use its flutter_sdk subdirectory as the path to flutter.\r\n2nd best: Instead, use it for the default path to flutter, allowing the user to change it in Preferences.\r\n3rd best: Allow a relative path for the flutter path in the preference, which would start from the project directory, or possibly use environment variables.\r\n",
