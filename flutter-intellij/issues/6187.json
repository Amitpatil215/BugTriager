Clicking on the \"Get Dependencies\" button in the banner also does not remove it, even though it runs `flutter pub get` in the package. Running 'Invalidate caches...\" and clearing out some of the caches and restarting also doesn't fix it.\r\n\r\nI've noticed this on both Linux and macOS.\r\n\r\n## Version info\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>flutter doctor -v</summary>\r\n[âœ“] Flutter (Channel remove_shortcut_manager_of, 3.1.0-0.0.pre.842, on macOS\r\n    12.4 21F79 darwin-x64, locale en)\r\n    â€¢ Flutter version 3.1.0-0.0.pre.842 at /Users/gspencer/code/flutter\r\n    â€¢ Upstream repository git@github.com:gspencergoog/flutter.git\r\n    â€¢ Framework revision dc3ec68da0 (18 hours ago), 2022-05-19 16:32:57 -0700\r\n    â€¢ Engine revision 8863b483b9\r\n    â€¢ Dart version 2.18.0 (build 2.18.0-136.0.dev)\r\n    â€¢ DevTools version 2.13.1\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 30.0.3)\r\n    â€¢ Android SDK at /Users/gspencer/Library/Android/sdk\r\n    â€¢ Platform android-31, build-tools 30.0.3\r\n    â€¢ ANDROID_HOME = /Users/gspencer/Library/Android/sdk\r\n    â€¢ Java binary at: /Applications/Android Studio with Blaze\r\n      Beta.app/Contents/jre/Contents/Home/bin/java\r\n    â€¢ Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build\r\n      11.0.12+0-b1504.28-7817840)\r\n    â€¢ All Android licenses accepted.\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Xcode - develop for iOS and macOS (Xcode 13.4)\r\n    â€¢ Xcode at /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer\r\n    â€¢ CocoaPods version 1.11.3\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Chrome - develop for the web\r\n    â€¢ Chrome at /Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Android Studio (version 2021.2)\r\n    â€¢ Android Studio at /Applications/Android Studio with Blaze\r\n      Beta.app/Contents\r\n    â€¢ Flutter plugin can be installed from:\r\n      ðŸ”¨ https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9212-flutter\r\n    â€¢ Dart plugin can be installed from:\r\n      ðŸ”¨ https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6351-dart\r\n    â€¢ Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build\r\n      11.0.12+0-b1504.28-7817840)\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Android Studio (version 2020.3)\r\n    â€¢ Android Studio at /Applications/Android Studio with Blaze.app/Contents\r\n    â€¢ Flutter plugin can be installed from:\r\n      ðŸ”¨ https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9212-flutter\r\n    â€¢ Dart plugin can be installed from:\r\n      ðŸ”¨ https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6351-dart\r\n    â€¢ Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.10+0-b96-7281165)\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Android Studio (version 2020.3)\r\n    â€¢ Android Studio at /Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents\r\n    â€¢ Flutter plugin can be installed from:\r\n      ðŸ”¨ https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9212-flutter\r\n    â€¢ Dart plugin can be installed from:\r\n      ðŸ”¨ https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6351-dart\r\n    â€¢ Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.10+0-b96-7281165)\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Android Studio (version 4.0)\r\n    â€¢ Android Studio at /Users/gspencer/Library/Application\r\n      Support/JetBrains/Toolbox/apps/AndroidStudio/ch-0/193.6514223/Android\r\n      Studio.app/Contents\r\n    â€¢ Flutter plugin can be installed from:\r\n      ðŸ”¨ https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9212-flutter\r\n    â€¢ Dart plugin can be installed from:\r\n      ðŸ”¨ https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6351-dart\r\n    â€¢ Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build\r\n      1.8.0_242-release-1644-b3-6222593)\r\n\r\n[âœ“] IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition (version 2021.2.2)\r\n    â€¢ IntelliJ at /Users/gspencer/Applications/IntelliJ IDEA CE.app\r\n    â€¢ Flutter plugin version 63.3.3\r\n    â€¢ Dart plugin version 212.5744\r\n\r\n[âœ“] VS Code (version 1.67.1)\r\n    â€¢ VS Code at /Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents\r\n    â€¢ Flutter extension version 3.38.1\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Connected device (2 available)\r\n    â€¢ macOS (desktop) â€¢ macos  â€¢ darwin-x64     â€¢ macOS 12.4 21F79 darwin-x64\r\n    â€¢ Chrome (web)    â€¢ chrome â€¢ web-javascript â€¢ Google Chrome 101.0.4951.64\r\n\r\n[âœ“] HTTP Host Availability\r\n    â€¢ All required HTTP hosts are available\r\n\r\nâ€¢ No issues found!\r\n</details>",
