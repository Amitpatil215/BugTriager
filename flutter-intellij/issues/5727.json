    "body": "At this point I am assuming that the plugin is responsible for setting up the environment correctly in Android Studio so that it can find CocoaPods so that flutter doctor --verbose and flutter run will work properly.\r\n\r\nRunning / Debugging on an Android device seems to work perfectly. That makes me believe that both the Flutter and Dart plugins are installed and work properly when communicating to an Android device.\r\n\r\nThis is occurring in my Android Studio project. This may be just a setup problem but I have not been able to find an answer on the internet. If this is a simple setup issue I would appreciate being pointed in the right direction.\r\n\r\nI know that CocoaPods is installed properly because it works perfectly from a bash shell command line. 'flutter run' on an iOS device works on the command line as well but it does not work in Android Studio.\r\n\r\nThe 'Flutter SDK' path is the same in both bash and Android Studio (see output of flutter doctor --verbose below).\r\nI don't see any settings in 'Android Studio > Preferences > Languages & Frameworks > Flutter' that might make a difference except the Flutter SDK path.\r\n\r\nThis seems to very similar to if not the same as this closed bug https://github.com/flutter/flutter-intellij/issues/4981\r\nI read through this bug and it didn't help. Somehow it just 'magically' started working for the person again.\r\n\r\niOS devices and emulators are recognized by the plugin so the 'flutter devices' must be working properly.\r\n\r\n'which pod' returns the same answer in the command line as well as Android Studio terminal.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nIn the bash command line type \"flutter doctor --verbose\"\r\nIf I open up \"Tool Windows > Terminal\" and run 'flutter doctor --verbose' it gets the same good answer.\r\nflutter run to an iOS device also works properly inside the terminal window but not when I run from Android studio.\r\nSo what else is left but the plugin?\r\nOutput looks good and says\r\n---\r\n[âœ“] Flutter (Channel stable, 2.2.3, on macOS 11.5.2 20G95 darwin-x64, locale en-US)\r\n    â€¢ Flutter version 2.2.3 at /Users/david.spells/flutter\r\n    â€¢ Framework revision f4abaa0735 (8 weeks ago), 2021-07-01 12:46:11 -0700\r\n    â€¢ Engine revision 241c87ad80\r\n    â€¢ Dart version 2.13.4\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Android toolchain -
