You should be able to create some Flutter projects in a common directory, and then open the parent directory to work on all of them together.

Just to be clear, my intent is to work on Flutter projects similarly to other Java/C# projects where you might have multiple 'primary' applications but a common backing library. In my case, I'm developing a 'lite' version of an application with a subset of features, so moving all the common Widget/Bloc work to a shared module seems to make the most sense. But I'd rather not have to keep 3 instances of Android Studio open to do it.\r\n\r\nI have found a workaround in the meantime (I think):\r\n- Create a new Flutter Module using the command line or as a separate Android Studio project.\r\n- Open the Project Structure dialog and select 'Modules'\r\n- Click on the 'add' icon and select 'Import Module'\r\n- Locate the folder of the previously created Module.\r\n- Select 'Create module from existing sources'  (importing does _not_ work here)\r\n- Unselect all the detected modules _except_ Flutter. and select 'Next'\r\n- Keep the detected Android module selected and click 'Finish'\r\n\r\nThis seems to get the second (or third) Flutter modules attached to the primary project with everything in-sync including separate git remotes.  So that's nice.\r\n",
