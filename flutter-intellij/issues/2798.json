We already display stdout in the console (since as you mention, there's output that goes straight to it as raw text and not `JSON`) so when running in verbose mode you just see the extra output in the debug console.\r\n\r\nI don't think verbose logging is the only stuff that goes raw to stdout though, so if we wanted to filter it we may need to fix that so other stuff doesn't disappear?",
