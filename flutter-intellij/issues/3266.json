If your issue is related to the Flutter framework itself,\r\nplease open an issue at\r\n[github.com/flutter/flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/new).\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nThe widget inspector UI looks too firmly like nothing will happen when it's just loading. \r\n\r\nAfter running an app and opening the panel, the content just firmly says there are no running Flutter apps. \r\n\r\nAfter a second or 2, it'll then say the widget tree will be displayed here.\r\n\r\nThen after another second or 2, it finally shows the actual tree. But along the process, it's essentially encouraging the user to leave since it seems like nothing will appear without any sort of indication that things are loading.\r\n\r\n## Version info\r\n\r\n[✓] Flutter (Channel tab-scaffold-tree-shape, v1.3.9-pre.17, on Mac OS X 10.14.3 18D109, locale en-US)\r\n    • Flutter version 1.3.9-pre.17 at /Users/xster/development/flutter\r\n    • Framework revision dd5b566ce2 (15 hours ago), 2019-03-07 19:45:19 -0800\r\n    • Engine revision f4951df193\r\n    • Dart version 2.2.1 (build 2.2.1-dev.0.0 571ea80e11)\r\n\r\n[!] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 28.0.3)\r\n    • Android SDK at /Users/xster/Library/Android/sdk\r\n    • Android NDK location not configured (optional; useful for native profiling support)\r\n    • Platform android-28, build-tools 28.0.3\r\n    • ANDROID_HOME = /Users/xster/Library/Android/sdk\r\n    • Java binary at: /Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jre/jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_152-release-1024-b01)\r\n    !
