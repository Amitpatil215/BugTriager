I think we need to make a change to something, and if that's true it would suggest we need to do something different. It might mean changing the advice to include `.android` (or some part of it) in SCM or change `flutter packages get` to make whatever change is needed for the IDEs.",

That causes an *.iml file to be generated: `.android/Flutter/fluter.iml`.\r\n\r\nThat *.iml file has lots of references to generated files, which aren't checked in to the repo. It has lots of references to versioned libraries from androidx and io.flutter. If those versions are changed by upgrading Android or Flutter then the *.iml file won't be correct.\r\n\r\nWe need to figure out how best to handle this. I don't know, but I'd be glad if @xster and @RedBrogdon could make suggestions. To me, it sort of looks like you have to use Android Studio to re-import modules into apps after upgrading either Flutter or Android.\r\n\r\nEDIT: To be clear, I was hoping there would be a way someone could check out the samples and use them without having to do manual configuration, like importing modules. But maybe that simple solution would be the best.",

It has lots of version dependencies that could change when Flutter or Android is updated. Actually, I think it needs to be regenerated after an update of either.\r\n\r\nWith some additional work, I think the second suggestion @xster made could be implemented. I'm not sure how the `flutter pub get` would work with the module import yet, but there's no technical issue stopping it that I know of. I'll add this to Q2. @devoncarew for planning.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I think there is a bug in the module import code in Android Studio that makes re-import break. That needs to get fixed (Q2 again). For now, @RedBrogdon it would be best if the samples we checked in without the mods made by the importer. That way we can tell people to do `flutter pub get` then import the module into the Android app. I'll get on that bug soon, but it will be next week at the earliest, meaning the fix will be in the release at the end of April.",
