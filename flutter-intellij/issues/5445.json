    "body": "Currently by default we completely truncate the stack traces for errors after the first error.  Truncating the stack trace for the errors is useful to avoid being overwhelmed by cascading errors but makes it difficult if you need to see a stack trace for an error that wasn't the first.\r\n\r\nWe work around this by having a setting to display all stack frames but few users will realize the setting exists so if we can solve the problem without requiring users to edit a setting that would be great.\r\nhttps://github.com/flutter/flutter-intellij/pull/5443/files\r\nIf the expandable blocks support in the default IntelliJ console is not sufficient we should probably wait and consider exposing the console from Dart DevTools with JXBrowser to support the functionality.",
