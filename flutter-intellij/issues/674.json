For example, a bunch of the stuff in the \"dev\" directory is missing.\r\n\r\nAlso, a bunch of the top-level directories are smashed together.  For example, hello_world and flutter_test are peers even though one is in the `examples` folder and one is in the `packages` folder.  This is important because the examples directory are just examples but the `packages` directory contains the actual shipping code.\r\n\r\nMaybe I shouldn't be using the project explorer and instead should use some sort of file-based view?",

Another option for editing the repo w/ IntelliJ would be to create separate projects (dev, examples, packages) for the different main directories - each would be open in a separate intellij windows. I'm not sure that's an improvement, as a refactoring in one project wouldn't affect the other projects.\r\n",
