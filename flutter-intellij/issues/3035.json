So ok my idea:\r\n\r\nIt will not involve any changes on Flutter side.\r\nCreate a wrapper around IOClient, this wrapper will basically use the IDE as a proxy and send http request to the IDE plugin. Then the plugin can execute request and show data but also interact with the requests (delay, change requests/responses).\r\n\r\nAnother solution to at least quickly having http reporting is that this IOClient wrapping just log all http information in a specific format, then the plugin can extract them to just show them under `Http monitoring` tab.\r\n\r\nThe developers would have to use this IOClient wrapper to see http reporting into their IDE. It could be as easy as `final ioClient = isProductionEnv ? IOClient() : ProxyIdeIoClient()`.\r\nWhat do you think ? ",

I'm happy and can change the code accordingly to set the correct header.\r\n\r\nI have same case for \"Breakpoint response\" that will show a popup for me to edit the response before it goes to the app. \r\n\r\nAnother case is just to \"add request delay\" like this I can add 1 minutes before the response is sent to the app, like this I can test the case where network is really low and see how it's handled on my app. \r\n\r\nClear enough @pq  ?
