    "body": "It would be nice if users could trigger AOT code size tooling analysis directly from the IDE. \r\n\r\nGoals:\r\nMake users aware of when they might have a code size problem directly from their IDE just like the performance page gives them an idea they might have a memory or cpu performance issue without leaving the IDE.\r\n \r\nA couple plausible workflows:\r\n1. Every time a profile or release build is generated, display the total code size in the console with a link to view a detailed code size breakdown in DevTools.\r\n2. Display the code size for the app integrated within the performance summary page. The summary page could provide a link to documentation on using the command line code size debugging tools if the code sie is a concern.\r\n\r\nFyi @kenzieschmoll \r\n",
