As soon as I change something in the source, its effects are normally picked up elsewhere (eg. adding an extra argument to a function, earlier call sites will start to show the now missing new argument). Probably related: Usages in other project files (Ctrl+B) doesn't work, either, it shows no usage anywhere for an element that clearly has many.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't happen in this project now. The project has the very same internal structure as others, practically identical layout, two modules in Project Structure, a main and an Android. Starting the compilation cures the analysis almost immediately, it's only the background analysis that probably stops with an error somewhere.\r\n\r\nI know it's very slim for reproducibility but I can't just wrap up the whole project and send it for inspection. Other projects and those I create right now from scratch work all right. Caches were invalidated.

Try this:\r\n - In the Project tool window, select `lib`\r\n - Right click (or whatever you do to show the context menu), scroll down to `Mark directory as` and slide over to the sub-menu to choose `Sources Root`\r\n - Close and re-open the project\r\n - Now you should have the missing line in your *.iml file\r\n\r\nI rather doubt that will change anything, because it didn't for me. My sample project was working just fine before and after.\r\n\r\nThe Dart plugin modifies roots, causing the stack trace. It has nothing to do with the Flutter plugin. Unless you have the experimental option to have Java and Kotlin indexed. Then we do add roots. Did you enable that? If so, does disabling it help?\r\n\r\nAlso, did you try disabling the Flutter Intl plugin?",

I made a clone, the usual way (duplicated the files, removed `.idea`, opened in AS, changed the Project window back to Project) -- and it works all right now!\r\n\r\nNow comes the fun part. Cloning obviously means a different folder. In this case, I cloned `netprinter` to `netprinter_xxx`. So, as the next step, I moved the old one out of the way, renamed `_xxx` back to the old name, deleted `.idea`, opened again). And it still works. What kinda suggests that I could have solved the whole problem just by removing `.idea` in the first place, still, it isn't that simple as recreating everything from scratch restored the error, too.\r\n\r\nSo, I kept a copy of both \"old\" and \"new\" and will methodically compare them, this times the files in `.idea`, to see what I can see. (And yes, the old one keeps showing the problem if I copy it back to the original place and open it up again).",
