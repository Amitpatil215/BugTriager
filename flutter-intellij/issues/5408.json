I did not know about that. We'll use that instead.\r\n\r\n@cadaniel wrote:\r\n> The error is actually I have custom schemes in the iOS project.\r\n\r\nExactly. The flutter command line tool doesn't know how to use your custom schemes. If you want to make things work for you now just perform the steps needed by the command line tool. If you do not want to perform those steps then you will continue to see this error.\r\n\r\nFuture work tracked in #5411",
