If it works in some projects but not others then there must be some difference in files. The Flutter plugin assumes (out of necessity) that the project root is the same as the directory created by `flutter create` and that the `android` or `.android` directories are immediate children of it. It also looks for the project file (ending with `.iml`). If that is missing or relocated it might cause a failure. The only way we could debug the actual problem is by examining a sample project that is known to fail. If you can create one I'd be glad to look into it.",
