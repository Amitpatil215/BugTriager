    "body": "Android Studio shows errors in `AndroidManifest.xml`. These errors are not material and do not cause a problem building the Android app version of the Flutter project. But 'Problems' are shown on the Project.\r\n\r\nI think this has been a problem with Flutter projects in Android Studio since BEFORE Flutter v1. Untidy errors like this create confusion and undermine confidence in Flutter. Given we are at Flutter v2.5.x and we want to improve Flutter maturity, we should seek to remove such 'bogus' errors reported in the Google supported IDE.\r\n\r\nThis may be an Android tool chain issue when part of a Flutter application, but I would have thought we could have resolved these by now. Its not a good look for Devs new to Flutter.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**\r\n\r\nAndroid Studio / File / New / New Flutter Project\r\nOpen AndroidManifest.xml located in /android/app/src/main\r\nThese errors shown:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5154664/136891344-dae8ac80-e79d-4e44-bded-bf37abcfcaa0.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5154664/136891358-233a9d3b-c82f-4cde-93e9-3e8eb1d02242.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Previous Issues Logged but Closed**\r\nThis issue or very very similar ones keep getting raised and closed.

            "body": "Android Studio is designed to edit Android apps, not Flutter apps. Flutter uses some of the Android framework, but is structured significantly differently than Android. When a Flutter app is open in Android studio the IDE does not recognize it as an Android app, and lots of errors are generated.\r\n\r\nThe Flutter plugin for Android Studio provides support for working with Flutter apps, but does not fully support Android. Our recommended approach for working on Android-specific portions of a Flutter app is to open the `android` module as a top-level project in Android Studio.\r\n\r\nAlternatively (when it works) you can enable an experimental option in the Flutter app that will cause the `android` app to be indexed, providing better support for working wth the Android module directly in the Flutter app. Check the box: `Preferences > Languages & Frameworks > Flutter > Enable code completion, navigation, etc. for Java / Kotlin`. There are two reasons this is not enabled by default: first, it requires Gradle sync a lot more, and second, it uses unsupported APIs that frequently get broken by IntelliJ updates (not Android Studio).\r\n\r\nTBH, repeatedly filing issues here, or Flutter, or Android, won't resolve the fundamental problem (everything works out-of-the-box). It is going to take some high-level coordination between Flutter and Android, which isn't on anyone's road map yet. @csells @adarshf @jacob314 for visibility of such.",

This provides more context and explains why this issue has been present so long.\r\n\r\nOne thing I might call out is that I'm very sure this information is not widely known within the Flutter community. So one thing that occurs straight away, is that perhaps we look to get this or similar onto the flutter.dev website? Probably somewhere like this page and specifically this section, which talks about the Flutter plugin and AS experience:\r\n\r\nhttps://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/android-studio#android-ide\r\n\r\nSo you'll note that this content implies a whole bunch of things, but is not the thorough background and context you've supplied here @stevemessick . So I suspect without this extra information, Flutter devs will continue to ask questions around this and will continue to log issues here or in the Flutter repo.\r\n\r\nNext thought @csells @adarshf @jacob314 and @domesticmouse ... how do we get the high-level coordination between Flutter and Android teams to achieve 'everything works out-of-the-box'?
