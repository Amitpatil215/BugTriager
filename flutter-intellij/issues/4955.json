However, it makes creating new folders in Flutter projects and unnecessary pain.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you create a new package (folder), and then create *another* package in that package, you wind up with one long name of both of your folders separated by a dot. It's non-straightforward to create files in the root directory after creating the second folder.\r\n\r\nThere are ways to mitigate this, like marking the folder as non-source in Android Studio but then you're marking your source code as 'non-source' which also seems counter-intuitive.",
