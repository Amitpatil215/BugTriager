The facet presumably would allow us to hide the Flutter-specific UI elements from non-Flutter Dart projects. As you know from Dart set-up, describing to a novice how to use the Project Structure window is a nightmare.\n\nWhat if we turn this around? We could define a Dart facet, and also make the Dart plugin provide a default Dart facet for use by Dart projects. The Dart plugin would get to its own SDK through the facet. Then a Flutter project could define a Dart facet, and use that to look up the Dart SDK. It would take some work in the Dart plugin. I think we're going to have to do some work there anyway to make the Dart plugin a bit more pluggable (so the Dart SDK that gets used by Flutter projects is the one in the Flutter SDK).\n\n@devoncarew @pq What do you guys think?\n",
