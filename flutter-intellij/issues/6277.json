That may be due to the Flutter SDK not being set, or some other configuration issue. Perhaps you changed the location of the Flutter SDK on disk before opening the project? If you're curious you can see if the problem is likely to re-occur. In your Flutter project, at the bottom of the Project tool window, expand External Libraries. There should be a library named Dart Packages. Expand that and look for flutter/src/widgets/widget_inspector.dart.\r\n\r\nIf everything looks OK and the problem happens anyway, then something very odd is happening.",
