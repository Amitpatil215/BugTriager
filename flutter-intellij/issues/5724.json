I don't know if that would work, but it may depend on the order of attachment. The Android Studio menu item is `Run > Flutter Attach`; it is also on the tool bar. Fair warning: Flutter Attach was designed to work for add-to-app projects; some people have reported success using it for regular apps, though. You might need to use additional arguments like `flutter run --start-paused --machine`. Some experimentation would be required. `flutter help run` lists all the arguments. The `--start-paused` arg is mostly used to ensure breakpoints are initialized before the app starts running. If you don't need to debug initialization then you may be able to omit it. (It has been a while since I looked at the debugger code.)",

I had to reinstall the app to fix this, but reinstalling doesn't actually always work/ fix the problem. I tried this 3 times, and only once this uninstalling/ reinstalling the app helped.\r\n\r\n---\r\nA separate issue:\r\n\r\n- When you attach and detach, another application becomes listed as an option to `flutter attach`. When I repeated this (e.g. attached, reattached, attached, reattached), and I had 3 applications that I could attach to:\r\n```\r\nThere are multiple observatory ports available.\r\nRerun this command with one of the following passed in as the appId:\r\n\r\n  flutter attach --app-id my.bundle.id\r\n  flutter attach --app-id my.bundle.id (2)\r\n  flutter attach --app-id my.bundle.id (3)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis means @jmagman 's suggestions regarding deattaching (pressing `d`) won't work on Android Studio, since Android Studio doesn't allow you to pass `-app-id` to flutter attach.",
