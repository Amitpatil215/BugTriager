Even it refused to accept android package. On hover over, it showed \"Unresolved reference: android\" and as a result every line of kotlin code is underlined red. I wasted 2 days to figure out whats wrong with my code but today i decided to run my app and it ran absolutely fine. So all those errors were fake. Plz solve it. It makes code unreadable. And i think its something to do with android sdk build-tools.\r\n\r\nBuild: AI-192.7142.36.36.6308749, 202003181856, \r\n\r\nAI-192.7142.36.36.6308749, JRE 1.8.0_212-release-1586-b04x64 JetBrains s.r.o, OS Windows 10(amd64) v10.0 , screens 1280x720\r\n\r\n\r\n[√] Flutter (Channel stable, v1.12.13+hotfix.9, on Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.18363.720], locale\r\n    en-IN)\r\n    • Flutter version 1.12.13+hotfix.9 at C:\\src\\flutter\r\n    • Framework revision f139b11009 (10 days ago), 2020-03-30 13:57:30 -0700\r\n    • Engine revision af51afceb8\r\n    • Dart version 2.7.2\r\n\r\n \r\n[√] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 29.0.3)\r\n    • Android SDK at C:\\Users\\vinay\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk\r\n    • Android NDK location not configured (optional; useful for native profiling support)\r\n    • Platform android-29, build-tools 29.0.3\r\n    • ANDROID_HOME = C:\\Users\\vinay\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk\r\n    • Java binary at: C:\\Program Files\\Android\\Android Studio\\jre\\bin\\java\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_212-release-1586-b04)\r\n    • All Android licenses accepted.\r\n\r\n[√] Android Studio (version 3.6)\r\n    • Android Studio at C:\\Program Files\\Android\\Android Studio\r\n    • Flutter plugin version 45.0.1\r\n    • Dart plugin version 192.7761\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_212-release-1586-b04)\r\n\r\n[√] VS Code (version 1.44.0)\r\n    • VS Code at C:\\Users\\vinay\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Microsoft VS Code\r\n    • Flutter extension version 3.9.1\r\n",
