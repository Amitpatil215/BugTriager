The Flutter tool tries to launch the app but hangs after printing \"Waiting for observatory port to be available...\". It should only take a few seconds to follow up with something like \"Observatory URL on device: http://127.0.0.1:43753/AOxQiPtomBw=/\".\r\n\r\nI have one more idea, if you have time for another experiment. Edit your run config and add `--verbose-system-logs` to the field named `Additional run args`. Then run it again and attach the log. And maybe try waiting for a minute or two before stopping the app, just in case there is something causing it to slow down.",
