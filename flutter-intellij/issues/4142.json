    "body": "As my project grows, IntelliJ is becoming unusable. It's been steadily becoming slower and slower as the project grows. I've been watching this get worse and worse for months.\r\n\r\nI'd say Flutter tooling is really bad in terms of performance for large projects. We have brand new, extremely fast computers, and yet, it halts all the time, all operations are slow. We're doing simple renames by hand, and stopped using autocomplete, because it just takes 5 seconds or so.  Today I turned off inspections, to make it a bit faster. When I open small projects it's really fast. Yes, our project is big, but when I open much larger Java and Kotlin projects the IDE works just fine. Everything is slow: Code completion, refactoring, importing, renaming, searching usages. This is all not at the same level as Java or Kotlin.\r\n\r\nFor example, if I search for usages of some method, it shows me the usages of all classes with that method name. For example, if I'm in MyClass and search usages of its method map it will show me usages of all Iterable classes, since all of them have a map method. This makes the search very slow, and it's never what I want. I want usages of MyClass.map obviously. And it also shows me dynamic variables with that name. Which is also not what I want. I believe the analyzer is being overwhelmed with all this noise, and it gets slow.\r\n\r\nIn any case, it seems to me the analyzer is just bad. For example, if I try to rename a private variable it should be fast, right? Just a single file to look at. Yet it takes a lot of time, as if it was searching the whole codebase. This issue is similar to https://github.com/flutter/flutter-intellij/issues/4012 but that issue was closed, and the problem still persists. In special this is still true for large projects:\r\n\r\n_\"It's slow enough that as I edit code, I can watch the syntax highlighting update about once every two to 15 seconds, which is far to slow to be useful. The suggestions dialog takes 3-4 seconds to show up, and another second or two to populate, sometimes showing the little in-menu spinner for ten seconds before showing any information, and sometimes it just gives up after 20 seconds or so with \"No Suggestions\" when I know for sure that there are valid suggestions to make.\"_\r\n\r\nAlso, it may not be just the analyzer. There are also issues when renaming/moving folders with more than 10 files (the number 10 is arbitrary, just a “larger” number of files) either not all references get updated or we’ll get an error saying \"Move File Exception - Exception when attempting to compute the file change for the file move: Server error: The edit.getRefactoring request was cancelled.\"\r\n\r\nFlutter surely is amazing, and you guys rock, but I wish Google would pay more attention to the basics. Makes no sense doing wonderful advanced stuff without first making sure the basics are rock solid. What good is having ML autocomplete, while the simple autocomplete doesn't work as it should because it's too slow? \r\n\r\n```\r\nflutter doctor -v\r\n[√] Flutter (Channel stable, v1.9.1+hotfix.6, on Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.17763.864], locale pt-BR)\r\n    • Flutter version 1.9.1+hotfix.6 at c:\\flutter\r\n    • Framework revision 68587a0916 (2 months ago), 2019-09-13 19:46:58 -0700\r\n    • Engine revision b863200c37\r\n    • Dart version 2.5.0\r\n[!] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 29.0.0)\r\n    • Android SDK at C:\\Users\\Marcelo\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\sdk\r\n    • Android NDK location not configured (optional; useful for native profiling support)\r\n    • Platform android-29, build-tools 29.0.0\r\n    • Java binary at: C:\\Program Files\\Android\\Android Studio\\jre\\bin\\java\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_202-release-1483-b03)\r\n    !

Yes, it might be caused by a slow Dart Analysis Server, but I also want to make sure it's not an IntelliJ Platform, Dart plugin or some 3rd party tool. So there are 2 things I'd like to ask for:\r\n- Logs (Help -> Compress Logs And Show In Explorer)\r\n- CPU snapshot that captures some slow operation. Several CPU snapshots for different slow operations would be even better. E.g. for code completion, local var renaming, just typing with slow highlighting update, etc. Instructions how to capture CPU snapshot are [here](https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/articles/207241235-Reporting-performance-problems#CPU_Snapshot_2019_2) (see '2019.2 and above' that suggests to use 'Performance Testing plug-in', Help -> Start/Stop CPU Usage Profiling).",

            "body": "@alexander-doroshko \r\n\r\nThanks very much for your analysis. Regarding this part:\r\n\r\n> Find toString() method usages snapshot. While I see something in the CPU snapshot that could probably be improved a bit on the Dart plugin end, I suppose that in general performance was pretty much fine during the Find Usages action. Just a few seconds for toString() search in a project with 30000 files is probably acceptable.\r\n> \r\n> Find Usages of method with unique name snapshot captured no performance problems at all. All was fast.\r\n> \r\n> Rename field snapshot: looks like no performance problems as well.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't seem correct. These take a really long time. For example, that rename of a public field of a private class takes from 2 to 15 seconds in my computer. The whole process I mean. Maybe the rename itself is fast in your logs, but it has to find usages, etc. Do your logs account for the whole process?\r\n\r\nIn more detail: Just to open the rename window it takes some time. I type Shift-F6 and it opens a dialog saying \"checking availability at the selection\". (by the way, I don't understand this message, availability of what, can you explain?). This dialog takes 2 to 3 seconds to disappear. Then the rename dialog opens.\r\n\r\nThen after you type the new name it takes some time, one or two seconds, to enable the Ok button. Yes, I have to wait until it enables the Ok button. What is it doing that prevents me to click that button right away? The rename itself, after you click the Ok button seems to be the fast part, and maybe that's what your logs are showing. But the whole process takes a lot of time, and this is proportional to the size of the project. It takes almost no time if the project is small.\r\n\r\nThe toString took more than a minute, is that what the logs show? Find Usages also takes a lot. If the logs don't show that then they are not the best tool to solve this. Maybe a video would be better for you to see the problem. \r\n\r\n",

The IDE should ask the server **after** we press the Ok button, not before. And then, only if necessary, it should let you know that it can't proceed because the name is invalid. \r\n\r\nEven so, how can it take seconds just to check if it's a valid name or not? It's probably checking if there are other variables with the same name. In Java it lets you know that there is a conflict, and gives you the option to proceed if you want. In Dart it just doesn't let you do it, which is bad because sometimes that's really what you want.\r\n\r\nSo I think there are two problems here:\r\n1) The Dart Analysis Server is very slow. Its speed must be greatly improved, orders of magnitude.\r\n2) Usability problems which are only visible when you have large projects and the server gets slow.\r\n",

Some thoughts:\r\n- the sluggish analysis server responses might be related to memory leaks. We're seeing reports of that here: https://github.com/flutter/flutter-intellij/issues/4143, thought that's for a more recent flutter beta version of the sdk than the version you're on. One way to verify this would be if you see speed improvements after restarting IntelliJ.\r\n- 3rd party plugins can now impact our user experience in ways we have less control or immediate awareness of\r\n- the fix for the gutter icon performance issue (https://github.com/flutter/flutter-intellij/issues/4012) has been committed but hasn't yet shipped with a plugin release. I see a few versions of IntelliJ listed above. If you're willing to try out a pre-release build of the plugin, let me know what version of IntelliJ you're using, and I can attach a build to this issue. That would let us know which issues have been resolved and which remain.\r\n\r\n",

The fact is that the IDE in my computer was slower than Hugo's, and then it became the same. I used it like this for a few days to get used to it, and then installed the plugin. I didn't notice any improvements with the new plugin (but maybe there were, just not very noticeable).\r\n\r\nThis is the situation now:\r\n\r\n* I noticed improvements when renaming fields. Now the rename-dialog opens instantly.\r\n\r\n* A lot of times the color/highlight syntax takes a few seconds to appear when some change is made or a Dart file is opened, indicating that the AST is still being calculated. Even with very large projects I never saw the code appear white while the AST was being calculated in Java, while in Dart that happens all the time. My conclusion is that things are faster now, but it's still much slower than Java's. The AST calculation needs to be improved a lot.\r\n\r\n* Find Usages is still slow, as previously reported. By the way, there is an usability problem here, because the Find Usages finds a lot of stuff which is not interesting. It searches properties with the same names for all objects in the project. So it wastes time searching useless stuff. **It should show only properties that would be changed if it was a Rename operation**.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

(not every file, only for the file that be imported from many other files)\r\n\r\nit seems like analyzer server doesn't update the cache tree well, and cause the objects leak. so the partial structure tree update will get slower and the tree itself get larger by each update. if you make many file editing and the memory will grow up and never end till out of memory. eventually, I only give the heap size 4GB so if I forgot to trigger restart, at least it will crash only in 4GB.\r\n\r\nbtw, you may need to upgrade your machine to higher performance and more cores. it may..... gets little better.

The problem reported in this issue has been thoroughly analyzed and addressed (see https://github.com/flutter/flutter-intellij/issues/4142#issuecomment-559531027). So most likely the problems noticed by other people have different nature.\r\n\r\nIn general, there may be 2 types of performance problems:\r\n- Dart Analysis Server working slowly with huge projects. In this case switching an IDE won't help, Analysis Server is a tool from the Dart SDK, it is used by all IDEs.\r\n- Performance problems come from the IntelliJ Platform, Dart plugin by JetBrains, or Flutter plugin by Google.\r\n\r\nIn any case we'd be happy to analyze each particular problem. To do this we'll need:\r\n- IDE and SDK versions, detailed problem description and steps to reproduce\r\n- IDE logs (Help -> Collect Logs and Diagnostics Data)\r\n- CPU snapshot that captures some slow operation. Help -> Diagnostics Tools -> Start CPU Usage Profiling. Reproduce the issue. Help -> Diagnostics Tools -> Stop CPU Usage Profiling.\r\n\r\nYou may file an issue right in the [JetBrains Issue Tracker](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/WEB) (Project: WebStorm, Subsystem: Dart). Logs may contain some sensitive data like project names and file paths. You may attach logs as visible to jetbrains-team only. We'll analyze each problem individually and will either fix it or move to the right place (which could be Dart SDK, Flutter plugin, 3rd-party plugin, etc.)",

So, things like code highlighting, code completion, refactorings, quick fixes, etc. should usually go to https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/.\r\n- However, sometimes Analysis Server is giving the correct information but IDE is doing something wrong with it. Also, there might be bugs in the IntelliJ Platform. In this case, JetBrains issue tracker is the right place.\r\n- Some Flutter-related features are added by the Flutter plugin by Google. Its issues are tracked here, in https://github.com/flutter/flutter-intellij/issues/\r\n\r\nIf you are unsure, feel free to start with the Dart plugin issue tracker or here in the Flutter plugin issue tracker.

So the right issue tracker would be https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/\r\n\r\nPlease file an issue with as many details as you can, including OS, Dart SDK version, project structure. Ideal bug report is the one that contains steps to reproduce and sample project attached. Though I know it's not always possible.\r\n\r\nAnalyzer instrumentation log may help to narrow down the issue with analyzer. To get logs: open Registry (searchable using Find Action (`Cmd+Shift+A` or `Ctrl+Shift+A`)), and add the following to the `dart.server.additional.arguments` property: `--instrumentation-log-file=/some/path/das.log`. Reproduce the problem and attach `das.log` to your bug report.\r\n\r\nI'm not from Google and I'm not working on analyzer, so I may help only with initial issue evaluation.
