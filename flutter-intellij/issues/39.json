It should be simple enough to test.\n\nTo do the build you'll also need a *.iml file (see https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-plugins/blob/master/Dart/Dart-community.iml), but again, this is easy enough to test that you have right- just right click on the plugin, and select to export it as a zip.  Then take it and try to install it in different places.\n\nAs for versions, I don't know of a way to specify via the direct plugin itself (I don't think that there is a way).  The convention in IJ is to have each plugin/build of the plugin depend on the framework version, see https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6351.  By having the Dart plugin build compatible with the same underlying versions, the jetbrains plugin repo can declare in the UI that the plugin is compatible with \"IntelliJ IDEA, PhpStorm, PyCharm, RubyMine, AppCode, CLion, Android Studio\".\n\nThe Flutter plugin will want to be aware of any IDEs such as these, but also the published versions of the Dart plugin, since it is a dependency.\n",
