Not very useful for us. (In case anyone needs to know how to find that, I used the Flutter plugin to create a Java project in Android Studio -- something you should not be able to do. Then I added a run config for an Application and used the environment variable tool to display the values.)\r\n\r\nIf I look at the same dialog using Chipmunk (canary) it shows a proper `PATH` value.\r\n\r\nI don't know how to fix it yet, but I'm going to talk with my team about possibilities.",
