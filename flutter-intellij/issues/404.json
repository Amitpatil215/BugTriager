    "body": "There are (at least) four ways to launch an app in IntelliJ.\r\n\r\nThere's a very attractive green ‚ñ∂ button in the toolbar. It does something you basically never want, which is run the app in release mode without assertions or anything.\r\n\r\nThere's a scary-looking üêû icon in the toolbar. It runs the app in debug mode, which is what you want, but even if you already have it running, it restarts the app from the top.\r\n\r\nThere's an icon that looks like ‚ö°‚ñ∂ half-way down the screen. This, I believe, does a hot reload. It's what you usually want.\r\n\r\nThere's also an ‚§ø icon next to it which I guess does a restart.\r\n\r\nThere are other icons (e.g. a Dart, the triangle to resume the debugger, another circular arrow in the debugger toolbar).\r\n\r\nIn the P4 and P5 usability studies for Flutter, we saw the following:\r\n\r\n- P4 hit the attractive green button multiple times, and would have continued doing that, getting no checked mode assertion development aids and suffering full rebuild load times rather than hot reload, if we hadn't intervened and suggested they try other options. IIRC, after the prompt, they used the bug icon over and over and never experienced hot reload.\r\n\r\n- P5 did eventually figure out hot reload but they too were initially confused.\r\n\r\nI think the current UI is a non-starter. Watching the participants try to use our current UI is painful.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nPersonally, I would propose the following design:\r\n\r\nA single ‚ñ∂ button that launches the app in debug mode if necessary, and does a hot reload if it's already running.\r\n\r\nA drop-down menu next to that button that offers the following options:\r\n* Hot reload (debug mode)\r\n* Restart (debug mode)\r\n* Profile mode\r\n* Release mode",

Maybe another set of icons would work better?\n",
