When working in a widget tree Intellij offers context options including \"wrap with widget\" or \"remove widget\".  Intellij currently supports adding a \"stream builder\" type widget but cannot subsequently remove that widget or other \"builder\" style widgets.  I can see the difficult cases involved, but wish for it nonetheless :)\r\n\r\nRe: \"Option to preserve single extra lines at the start of a class, array, etc.\"\r\n\r\nNow that I look more closely I think this may be an issue with `dartfmt` and not Intellij.  Perhaps the wishlist item should be for more control over or a replacement for that formatting.\r\n\r\nThanks again!\r\n",
