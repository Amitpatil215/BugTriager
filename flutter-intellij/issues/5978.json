            "body": "Thanks for the link. Apparently, something can get mis-configured in the project that causes completion to stop working correctly. Completion is complex; it is actually implemented in the Dart plugin, which uses the Dart analysis server to do the heavy lifting of computing suggestions, but also provides a hook that the Flutter plugin uses to support its outline. So, in theory, something could go wrong in any of the three components (Dart plugin, Flutter plugin, Dart analyzer).\r\n\r\nIt sounds like you are in good shape now. If this happens again, please let us know. For now, I'm going to keep it open and hope I get some time to investigate the tutorial you referenced.\r\n\r\nOne more thing. I mentioned `flutter pub upgrade` earlier, and I see @bwilkerson mentioned a couple symptoms related to that. My hope was that `flutter pub upgrade` would rebuild the pub cache, but you may need to do `flutter clean` first. If you still have the broken project, could you try doing `Flutter Clean` then `Flutter Pub Upgrade` -- they are both on the `Tools > Flutter` nested menu. Then let us know if anything changed. I appreciate your help tracking this down.",

Did you do `flutter pub get` (which the IDE automatically does if you use the menu)? II don't recall why `flutter pub get` is different from `pub get` (which is now `dart pub get`), but apparently it is.\r\n\r\nAnd then you could try deleting the `.dart_tool` directory and doing `flutter pub get` to see if that helps.",

When creating a project, the Model Name named a capitalized English word, and then auto-completion has been like this for the past few days that I have been studying, and it cannot be auto-completed. , today I accidentally changed the Model Name file name to English words starting with lowercase, and then opened the project in Android Studio, and auto-completion was fine.\r\n\r\nThat's interesting. I'm not sure what `Model Name` refers to, but based on the capitalization comment I tried changing the name of `main.dart` to `Main.dart` and changed the project name in `pubspec.yaml` to use camel-case. Neither had an effect on completion, though.\r\n\r\n@BojanDolic Could your project be affected by capitalization?",
