    "body": "## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n0. Let's say that i have a simple stateful MyApp widget with a MaterialApp widget inside (the sample code is below).\r\n1. When I first run the app on the web (Chrome browser) everything is okay: the initState and the build method is called once\r\n2. Then i save without any change, which triggers a hot restart and it seems that everything is okay: the initState and the build method is called again and only once\r\n3. Now if i do something on the site (button hover or window resize, etc), then the build method is called again once. The question is why? It should no be called.\r\n\r\nThis is the output of the Intellij console after step 3:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPerforming hot restart...\r\nWaiting for connection from debug service on Chrome...\r\nRestarted application in 2,556ms.\r\nMyApp initState called\r\nMyApp build called\r\nMyApp build called\r\n```\r\n\r\nComplete code to reproduce the problem:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\r\n\r\nvoid main() => runApp(MyApp());\r\n\r\nclass MyApp extends StatefulWidget {\r\n  const MyApp({Key? key}) : super(key: key);\r\n\r\n  @override\r\n  State<MyApp> createState() => _MyAppState();\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {\r\n  @override\r\n  void initState() {\r\n    super.initState();\r\n    print('MyApp initState called');\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @override\r\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\r\n    print('MyApp build called');\r\n    return MaterialApp(\r\n      title: 'Welcome to Flutter',\r\n      home: Scaffold(\r\n        appBar: AppBar(\r\n          title: const Text('Welcome to Flutter'),\r\n        ),\r\n        body: Center(\r\n          child: OutlinedButton(\r\n            onPressed: () {},\r\n            child: const Text('Button'),\r\n          ),\r\n        ),\r\n      ),\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nBy the way if i run the app directly using the flutter cli (outside Intellij) with the following command and i hit 'r' to trigger a hot restart, then the hot restart is waiting and executed only if the focus is on the browser. And there are no unnecessary builds in the hot restart instance even if i do something on the site. I don't think that's a coincidence.\r\n\r\n`flutter run -d chrome`\r\n\r\n## Version info\r\n\r\n```\r\n/Users/.../development/flutter/bin/flutter doctor --verbose\r\n[✓] Flutter (Channel stable, 2.5.3, on macOS 12.0.1 21A559 darwin-x64, locale en-HU)\r\n    • Flutter version 2.5.3 at /Users/.../development/flutter\r\n    • Upstream repository https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git\r\n    • Framework revision 18116933e7 (6 weeks ago), 2021-10-15 10:46:35 -0700\r\n    • Engine revision d3ea636dc5\r\n    • Dart version 2.14.4\r\n\r\n[!] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 29.0.3)\r\n    • Android SDK at /Users/.../Library/Android/sdk\r\n    ✗ cmdline-tools component is missing\r\n      Run `path/to/sdkmanager --install \"cmdline-tools;latest\"`\r\n      See https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line for more details.\r\n    ✗ Android license status unknown.\r\n      Run `flutter doctor --android-licenses` to accept the SDK licenses.\r\n      See https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/macos#android-setup for more details.\r\n\r\n[!] Xcode - develop for iOS and macOS\r\n    • Xcode at /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer\r\n    • Xcode 13.1, Build version 13A1030d\r\n    !

I think it has something to do with how the app runs when started with the `--machine` option (which IDEs use to enable control of the app).\r\n\r\nThis isn't specific to web apps.
