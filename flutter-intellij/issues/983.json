    "body": "Summary:\r\nDoing a hot reload after removing a breakpoint, during a debug session, seems to reactivate the breakpoint. The red dot on the left is still gone, but the app still pauses when it gets there. Placing a new breakpoint on the same line and then removing it, fixes the problem.\r\n\r\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n1. Create a new project.\r\n2. Set a breakpoint at the line with _counter++;\r\n3. Run in debug mode (I used iOS SE simulator, but it also happened with an android simulator).\r\n4. Tab the button and resume a couple of times\r\n5. Remove the breakpoint and verify that the app no longer pauses.\r\n6. Do a hot reload.\r\n7. Tab the button again.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\r\nExpected:\r\nThe number should increase by one without any interruption.\r\n\r\nActual:\r\nThe app pauses where the breakpoint used to be.\r\n\r\nWhat version of the product are you using?\r\nFlutter framework revision 87d0010adb, 2017-05-02 22:20:14 -0700\r\nTools Dart version 1.23.0-dev.11.11\r\n\r\nIntelliJ IDEA CE 2017.1.2\r\nFlutter plugin version 13.0\r\n\r\nOn what operating system?\r\nmacOS Sierra 10.12.3\r\n\r\nPlease provide any additional information below.\r\nNote that this might have been the case for earlier versions as well, since I've seen this before, but was unable to reproduce it.",
