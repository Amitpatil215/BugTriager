Edit android/app/build.gradle and add a dependency, for example these are my dependencies after adding play services maps:\n\n```\ndependencies {\n    implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-maps:15.0.1'\n    testImplementation 'junit:junit:4.12'\n    androidTestImplementation 'com.android.support.test:runner:1.0.2'\n    androidTestImplementation 'com.android.support.test.espresso:espresso-core:3.0.2'\n}\n\n```\n\n3.  Use the dependency in Java code, here's a simple MainActivity.java to illustrate the issue:\n\n```java\npackage com.example.flutterapp;\n\nimport android.os.Bundle;\n\nimport io.flutter.app.FlutterActivity;\nimport io.flutter.plugins.GeneratedPluginRegistrant;\n\nimport com.google.android.gms.maps.MapView;\n\npublic class MainActivity extends FlutterActivity {\n  MapView mapView;\n\n  @Override\n  protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n    mapView = new MapView(this);\n    GeneratedPluginRegistrant.registerWith(this);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nEXPECTED RESULT:\nAndroid Studio is happy.\n\nOBSERVED RESULT:\nThe app builds and runs, but Android studio doesn't recognize symbols from the dependency added in step 2:\n\n[![screenshot from 2018-08-22 12-53-13](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1024117/44487135-5de56a80-a60a-11e8-9d96-b2c42c50937b.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1024117/44487135-5de56a80-a60a-11e8-9d96-b2c42c50937b.png)\n\n*This issue was moved by [devoncarew](https://github.com/devoncarew) from [flutter/flutter#20924](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/20924).*",

The libraries are not getting set up quite right and the Gradle build isn't doing everything correctly yet (plus it is too distracting). If you want to give it a try go to the Flutter preference page and turn on the bottom check box under Experiments (something about code completion for Java). You need to restart Android Studio after enabling it. Make sure you are using at least version 27.1 of the Flutter plugin.",
