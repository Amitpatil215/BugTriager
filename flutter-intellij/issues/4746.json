Install Android studio `sudo snap install android-studio --classic`\r\n2. Install flutter `sudo snap install flutter --classic`\r\n3. Install Linux dependencies `sudo apt-get install clang cmake ninja-build pkg-config libgtk-3-dev`\r\n4. Set flutter up `flutter channel dev &&  flutter upgrade && flutter config --enable-linux-desktop`\r\n5. Create and run a dummy flutter project `flutter create counter && cd counter && flutter run -d linux`\r\n6. Open Android studio\r\n7. Install dart and flutter plugins\r\n8. Restart Android studio\r\n9. Open the _counter_ project just created\r\n10. On the top select *Linux* as device\r\n11. Click on `main.dart` and edit configuration to add `--verbose` to _Additional Arguments_\r\n12. Click run\r\n\r\nBuild fails with the following output:\r\n```\r\n[  +86 ms] executing: [/home/fabio/snap/flutter/common/flutter/] git -c log.showSignature=false log -n 1 --pretty=format:%H\r\n[  +21

            "body": "Thanks for the report. Unfortunately, I don't have Linux so I can't help much.\r\n\r\nI see a couple differences in the command executed following `Launching lib/main.dart on Linux in debug mode...`\r\n- The one launched from the IDE includes `-Dflutter.inspector.structuredErrors=true`\r\n- The one from the command line has `--filesystem-scheme org-dartlang-root`\r\n\r\nWhich makes me wonder if the command line version would work if you include the `--machine` option. The IDE also adds the `--start-paused` option. If you have a chance could you try running `flutter run --machine --verbose` from the command line? Another thing to try would be adding `--filesystem-scheme org-dartlang-root` to the run config in the IDE.\r\n\r\nI notice your Linux toolchain has different versions of most items. Why would that be? Also, ninja says `ninja: warning: bad deps log signature or version; starting over` running from the command line (which is the older version) but not from the IDE. That happens almost immediately after it starts. I'm not familiar with ninja so I don't know if that is significant.",

It might be because of the snaps environment, but I'm not sure at all. I really think that when run from the IDE somehow the wrong toolchain is selected, but I'm not sure what component is to blame..\r\n\r\n> Also, ninja says ninja: warning: bad deps log signature or version; starting over running from the command line (which is the older version) but not from the IDE. That happens almost immediately after it starts. I'm not familiar with ninja so I don't know if that is significant.\r\n\r\nI'm not familiar with it either, however it happens both from command line or IDE, so I think it's unlikely to be the cause of the issue. \r\n\r\n",

I'll make a comment to that effect on the flutter-snap repo issue.\r\n",
