    "body": "The Flutter plugin in Android Studio does not recognise packages in sub-folders when the root project folder is not a Flutter project.\r\n\r\nA workaround is to add a dummy `pubspec.yaml` file with the Flutter SDK dependency but this adds noise and may result in other unwanted files being generated like `pubspec.lock`, `.packages` and those in `.dart_tool`.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ mkdir test\r\n$ cd test\r\n$ flutter create project1\r\n$ flutter create project2\r\n```\r\n\r\nOpen the folder \"test\" in Android Studio.  Neither project1 nor project2 will show as Flutter projects.\r\n\r\nWe find this approach of opening a common parent folder to be useful for local development with the sub-folders representing different Flutter packages in different git repositories.  This is particularly useful when combined with a `pubspec_overrides.yaml` file.\r\n\r\n## Version info\r\n\r\n```\r\n[âœ“] Flutter (Channel stable, 3.0.0, on macOS 12.1 21C52 darwin-arm, locale en-GB)\r\n    â€¢ Flutter version 3.0.0 at /Users/Scott/Developer/flutter\r\n    â€¢ Upstream repository https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git\r\n    â€¢ Framework revision ee4e09cce0 (9 days ago), 2022-05-09 16:45:18 -0700\r\n    â€¢ Engine revision d1b9a6938a\r\n    â€¢ Dart version 2.17.0\r\n    â€¢ DevTools version 2.12.2\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 29.0.2)\r\n    â€¢ Android SDK at /Users/Scott/Library/Android/sdk\r\n    â€¢ Platform android-31, build-tools 29.0.2\r\n    â€¢ ANDROID_SDK_ROOT = /Users/Scott/Library/Android/sdk/tools\r\n    â€¢ Java binary at: /Users/Scott/Library/Application Support/JetBrains/Toolbox/apps/AndroidStudio/ch-0/211.7628.21.2111.8139111/Android Studio.app/Contents/jre/Contents/Home/bin/java\r\n    â€¢ Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.11+0-b60-7772763)\r\n    â€¢ All Android licenses accepted.\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Xcode - develop for iOS and macOS (Xcode 13.3.1)\r\n    â€¢ Xcode at /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer\r\n    â€¢ CocoaPods version 1.11.2\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Chrome - develop for the web\r\n    â€¢ Chrome at /Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Android Studio (version 2021.1)\r\n    â€¢ Android Studio at /Users/Scott/Library/Application Support/JetBrains/Toolbox/apps/AndroidStudio/ch-0/211.7628.21.2111.8139111/Android Studio.app/Contents\r\n    â€¢ Flutter plugin can be installed from:\r\n      ðŸ”¨ https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9212-flutter\r\n    â€¢ Dart plugin can be installed from:\r\n      ðŸ”¨ https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6351-dart\r\n    â€¢ Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.11+0-b60-7772763)\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Android Studio (version 2021.1)\r\n    â€¢ Android Studio at /Users/Scott/Library/Application Support/JetBrains/Toolbox/apps/AndroidStudio/ch-0/211.7628.21.2111.8092744/Android Studio.app/Contents\r\n    â€¢ Flutter plugin can be installed from:\r\n      ðŸ”¨ https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9212-flutter\r\n    â€¢ Dart plugin can be installed from:\r\n      ðŸ”¨ https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6351-dart\r\n    â€¢ Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.11+0-b60-7772763)\r\n\r\n[âœ“] IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition (version 2021.3.2)\r\n    â€¢ IntelliJ at /Users/Scott/Library/Application Support/JetBrains/Toolbox/apps/IDEA-U/ch-1/213.6777.52/IntelliJ IDEA.app\r\n    â€¢ Flutter plugin can be installed from:\r\n      ðŸ”¨ https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9212-flutter\r\n    â€¢ Dart plugin can be installed from:\r\n      ðŸ”¨ https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6351-dart\r\n\r\n[âœ“] IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition (version 2021.3.1)\r\n    â€¢ IntelliJ at /Users/Scott/Library/Application Support/JetBrains/Toolbox/apps/IDEA-U/ch-1/213.6461.79/IntelliJ IDEA.app\r\n    â€¢ Flutter plugin can be installed from:\r\n      ðŸ”¨ https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9212-flutter\r\n    â€¢ Dart plugin can be installed from:\r\n      ðŸ”¨ https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6351-dart\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Connected device (2 available)\r\n    â€¢ macOS (desktop) â€¢ macos  â€¢ darwin-arm64   â€¢ macOS 12.1 21C52 darwin-arm\r\n    â€¢ Chrome (web)    â€¢ chrome â€¢ web-javascript â€¢ Google Chrome 101.0.4951.64\r\n\r\n[âœ“] HTTP Host Availability\r\n    â€¢ All required HTTP hosts are available\r\n\r\nâ€¢ No issues found!\r\n```\r\n\r\nEdit: Added missed `cd test` step",
