If your issue is related to the Flutter framework itself,\r\nplease open an issue at\r\n[github.com/flutter/flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/new).\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nSo initially this worked, but I have a bigger project with multiple modules based on on either flutter or java (for API development), like this:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/553512/136531578-1a68e098-e98d-49ef-83f3-7e4a076d9a09.png)\r\n\r\nInitially the main project SDK was set to Android and I added a flutter app and it worked, but with adding some java modules I switched main project SDK to JDK and worked on those apis, today I tried to test again mobile app with latest APIs, but it says:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/553512/136532012-867cb790-9127-4ba2-abc7-1f658c2571f5.png)\r\n\r\nWhen I open AVD manager I can start the emulator without issues:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/553512/136532180-fd96dbfc-11ee-465b-b267-a64842c18e6e.png)\r\n\r\nI tried to connect directly to phone via wifi, by:\r\nover USB do: \r\n[11:33:23] zangetsu@zeus  $  ~  adb tcpip 5555\r\nrestarting in TCP mode port: 5555\r\nAnd then: \r\n[11:33:28] zangetsu@zeus  $  ~  adb connect 192.168.88.97:5555\r\nconnected to 192.168.88.97:5555\r\n\r\nNo, my phone is directly visible in idea, but same result:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/553512/136533748-edce605d-f31c-4405-86b6-d9e906e23c9d.png)\r\n\r\nMy project SDK settings, I switched back from JDK to Android SDK:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/553512/136533852-45419e4d-5dd0-485a-9eca-f5df37b7229d.png)\r\n\r\nAnd also configured it on module itself:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/553512/136534062-508ed18c-5858-47dd-843b-f785f5e21cd2.png)\r\n\r\nI am watching idea log, but don't see much..\r\n\r\nWhen running manually from command-line it works:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/553512/136538284-be6baf8c-2acb-42fa-9549-ac7a52cbea53.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Version info\r\n\r\n[✓] Flutter (Channel master, 2.6.0-12.0.pre.222, on Gentoo/Linux 5.13.10-gentoo-x86_64, locale en_US.utf8)\r\n    • Flutter version 2.6.0-12.0.pre.222 at /data/proj/private/flutter\r\n    • Upstream repository https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git\r\n    • Framework revision ed60103645 (2 days ago), 2021-10-06 06:53:04 -0400\r\n    • Engine revision f967ebb685\r\n    • Dart version 2.15.0 (build 2.15.0-178.0.dev)\r\n\r\n[✓] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 31.0.0)\r\n    • Android SDK at /data/devel/sdk/android\r\n    • Platform android-31, build-tools 31.0.0\r\n    • ANDROID_HOME = /data/devel/sdk/android\r\n    • ANDROID_SDK_ROOT = /data/devel/sdk/android\r\n    • Java binary at: /opt/android-studio/jre/bin/java\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.10+0-b96-7249189)\r\n    • All Android licenses accepted.\r\n\r\n[✓] Chrome - develop for the web\r\n    • CHROME_EXECUTABLE = /usr/bin/google-chrome-stable\r\n\r\n[✓] Linux toolchain - develop for Linux desktop\r\n    • clang version 12.0.1\r\n    • cmake version 3.21.3\r\n    • ninja version 1.10.2\r\n    • pkg-config version 0.29.2\r\n\r\n[✓] Android Studio (version 2020.3)\r\n    • Android Studio at /opt/android-studio\r\n    • Flutter plugin version 61.2.2\r\n    • Dart plugin version 203.8430\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.10+0-b96-7249189)\r\n\r\n[✓] Android Studio\r\n    • Android Studio at /opt/android-studio/\r\n    • Flutter plugin can be installed from:\r\n      🔨 https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9212-flutter\r\n    • Dart plugin can be installed from:\r\n      🔨 https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6351-dart\r\n    • android-studio-dir = /opt/android-studio/\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.10+0-b96-7249189)\r\n\r\n[✓] IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition (version 2021.2)\r\n    • IntelliJ at /opt/idea-ultimate-bin-2021.2.2\r\n    • Flutter plugin version 61.2.4\r\n    • Dart plugin version 212.5486\r\n\r\n[✓] Connected device (3 available)\r\n    • Android SDK built for x86 (mobile) • emulator-5554 • android-x86    • Android 11 (API 30) (emulator)\r\n    • Linux (desktop)                    • linux         • linux-x64      • Gentoo/Linux 5.13.10-gentoo-x86_64\r\n    • Chrome (web)                       • chrome        • web-javascript • Google Chrome 94.0.4606.81\r\n\r\n• No issues found!\r\n\r\n",
