If your issue is related to the Flutter framework itself,\r\nplease open an issue at\r\n[github.com/flutter/flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/new).\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nWhen I use Android studio or intellij to create flutter project,\r\nWhen opening lib/main.dart for editing, in class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage>, you can normally use the code completion function to re-parent the method, such as initState(),\r\nBut when I open the directory for Android at the moment app/src/main/kotlin/com/example/my_flutter/MainActivity.kt\r\nThe development tool has a loading process. After that, when you go back to main.dart to edit the code, you cannot use the code completion function to overload the parent class method initState().\r\nAlso, many code completion functions do not work properly. I tried recreating the project, and reinstalling the development tools did not restore this code completion unless I reinstalled Windows.\r\nThis question has been bothering me for a long time, and I hope to get your reply. thanks\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16185860/176145662-5eaf636d-00f5-44b7-a27a-1b8047d53e8c.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16185860/176145774-8e11ad1a-e0a9-47e8-b94f-da6204b659ed.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Version info\r\n\r\n[√] Flutter (Channel beta, 3.1.0, on Microsoft Windows [版本 10.0.19042.1766], locale zh-CN)\r\n    • Flutter version 3.1.0 at D:\\flutter\\flutter\r\n    • Upstream repository https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git\r\n    • Framework revision bcea432bce (5 weeks ago), 2022-05-26 09:05:34 -0700\r\n    • Engine revision 44e5b38ee8\r\n    • Dart version 2.18.0 (build 2.18.0-44.1.beta)\r\n    • DevTools version 2.12.2\r\n\r\n[√] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 33.0.0)\r\n    • Android SDK at D:\\Android\\Sdk\r\n    • Platform android-33, build-tools 33.0.0\r\n    • Java binary at: D:\\downlaods\\android-studio-2021.1.1.23-windows\\android-studio\\jre\\bin\\java\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.11+9-b60-7590822)\r\n    • All Android licenses accepted.\r\n\r\n[√] Chrome - develop for the web\r\n    • Chrome at C:\\Program Files\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe\r\n\r\n[X] Visual Studio - develop for Windows\r\n    X Visual Studio not installed; this is necessary for Windows development.\r\n    • Dart plugin can be installed from:\r\n       https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6351-dart\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.11+9-b60-7590822)\r\n\r\n[√] IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition (version 2022.1)\r\n    • IntelliJ at D:\\Program Files\\JetBrains\\IntelliJ IDEA 2022.1.2\r\n    • Flutter plugin version 68.1.4\r\n    • Dart plugin version 221.5787.37\r\n\r\n[√] Connected device (3 available)\r\n    • Windows (desktop) • windows • windows-x64    • Microsoft Windows [版本 10.0.19042.1766]\r\n    • Chrome (web)      • chrome  • web-javascript • Google Chrome 102.0.5005.115\r\n    • Edge (web)        • edge    • web-javascript • Microsoft Edge 102.0.1245.44\r\n\r\nHTTP Host availability check is taking a long time...[!] HTTP Host Availability                                                         \r\n    X HTTP host \"https://maven.google.com/\" is not reachable.
