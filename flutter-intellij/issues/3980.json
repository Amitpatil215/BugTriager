    "body": "For developing a plugin for Flutter, I would like to hook into the Flutter Outline. From my understanding, the Flutter Outline is able to render a visual representation of Dart UI code because it processes FlutterOutline objects. FlutterOutline objects are created from JSON. The JSON is generated somewhere in the Dart Language Server.\r\n\r\nMy two questions are:\r\n1. Where does the Flutter Outline get the JSON from? \r\n2. What is the channel/method that passes data from the Dart Analysis server to the plugin? How can I hook into the Dart Analysis server and get the raw Flutter Outline output?\r\n\r\nPlease let me know my assumptions are correct. I think if there's a way to hook into the Flutter Outline, then you can create configurators that modify widget values through dropdowns, pickers, etc. ",
