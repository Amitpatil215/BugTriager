You're teams would have a better feel for the best implementation, but I have a feeling having a stful-page could be useful. I'll let that boil it self out. \r\n\r\nI have noticed that none of the page implementations are consistent between the samples, and could be nifty to help guide a consistency, and maybe more time is needed to get there. Now folks are asking about MVC, and so I wonder how that my play apart. Like using the flux api too. Best of luck, on thinking about how you want to guide the process.",

My initial hope was to show how to create `stful`, etc. and let everyone do their own, with the expectation that more and better templates (like `stful-page`) would be created. I think a lot of people don't want to bother with creating templates, though. I wonder if there is a simple way to share files that define templates and can just be dropped into an IntelliJ installation?\r\n\r\nIf it looks like enough people would use (some version of) `stful-page` I'd have no problem adding it to the pre-defined set. The trade-off is that each new template increases the pop-up menu length. But this one is so complex that, if useful, it would easily earn a place. My totally uninformed opinion is this one would get a lot of use. I'd like to hear what people who write real Flutter apps have to say.",
