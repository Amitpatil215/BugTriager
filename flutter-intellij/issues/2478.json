If we simply hide Colors.white when types don't match, the user might find it surprising that there is no white in Colors. \r\n\r\nAs far as Colors.accents, I'm not too concerned about it, since the name suggests it's not a color and IntelliJ doesn't show a color preview for it in the autocomplete dialog.
