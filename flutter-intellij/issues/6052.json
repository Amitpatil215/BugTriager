Finally managed to circle back on it and I'm putting together a new PR for this issue, just running into a few issues re: Gradle and the `compileClasspath` target. It's likely due to my own lack of deep Gradle familiarity, but there's some weird caching behavior that happens where the 'compileClasspath' dependency is never 'refreshed'.\r\n\r\nEx: In early testing on Windows 10, the linux.targ.gz library is downloaded and unpacked to the artifact folder. After realizing I'd need the windows binary, I deleted the `flutter-intellij/artifacts` path and unpacked the Windows versions of IdeaIC and Android-Studio, but would still get Gradle exceptions during the `compileKotlin` phase indicating that it was trying to compile `lib/ffmpeg...-linux.jar` libraries instead of the windows versions that were now in the artifact folder.  I ended up having to delete the entire gradle cache in my user directory, rebuilt from scratch, but now it links to the Android Studio libraries.  So whenever I execute the `[runIdea]` target, it launches the latest AS, not IntelliJ.  \r\n\r\nAgain, this is likely to me not having a deep familiarity with Gradle. Where should I start the troubleshooting on this one? I don't want to push this PR and cause noise until I have a better grasp of what's happening...\r\n\r\n[Branch under development](https://github.com/firephreek/flutter-intellij/tree/support_windows_platform)\r\n",
