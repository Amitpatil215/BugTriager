For example. using the CodeLab, I imported the \r\n`import 'package:english_words/english_words.dart';` in my class. I do not see the autocomplete working correctly for this package. Only when I type the complete class name, I see the methods in the class. \r\nExample:\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-03-31 at 9 47 38 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16784627/78028043-bf1c0680-7334-11ea-8929-de31a3428b17.png)\r\nOn line number 9, I had to type the whole class name and for demo purpose, I am showing the issue on line number 10 where you can see the autocomplete does not work. \r\n\r\n## Version info\r\n```\r\n[✓] Flutter (Channel stable, v1.12.13+hotfix.8, on Mac OS X 10.15.3 19D76, locale en-CA)\r\n    • Flutter version 1.12.13+hotfix.8 at /Users/asharma/Library/flutter\r\n    • Framework revision 0b8abb4724 (7 weeks ago), 2020-02-11 11:44:36 -0800\r\n    • Engine revision e1e6ced81d\r\n    • Dart version 2.7.0\r\n\r\n[!] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 29.0.2)\r\n    • Android SDK at /Users/asharma/Library/Android/sdk\r\n    • Android NDK location not configured (optional; useful for native profiling support)\r\n    • Platform android-29, build-tools 29.0.2\r\n    • ANDROID_HOME = /Users/asharma/Library/Android/sdk\r\n    • Java binary at: /Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jre/jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_202-release-1483-b49-5587405)\r\n    !
