Make an app\r\n2. Install `video_player` and include a view with running video and some `print` or `log` statements\r\n3. Your log output is spammend with verbose output and it is very hard to even find what you intended to log\r\n\r\n\r\n## Version info\r\n\r\n```\r\n[√] Flutter (Channel master, 1.22.0-10.0.pre.385, on Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.18363.1082], locale en-DE)\r\n    • Flutter version 1.22.0-10.0.pre.385 at D:\\dev\\flutter\\sdk\r\n    • Framework revision 73b6398932 (10 hours ago), 2020-09-28 11:07:32 +0800\r\n    • Engine revision 3a73d073c8\r\n    • Dart version 2.11.0 (build 2.11.0-161.0.dev)\r\n\r\n[!] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 29.0.3)\r\n    • Android SDK at C:\\Users\\User\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\sdk\r\n    • Platform android-30, build-tools 29.0.3\r\n    • Java binary at: C:\\Program Files\\Android\\Android Studio\\jre\\bin\\java\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_242-release-1644-b01)\r\n    X Android license status unknown.\r\n      Run `flutter doctor --android-licenses` to accept the SDK licenses.\r\n      See https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/windows#android-setup for more details.\r\n\r\n[√] Android Studio (version 4.0)\r\n    • Android Studio at C:\\Program Files\\Android\\Android Studio\r\n    • Flutter plugin version 49.0.2\r\n    • Dart plugin version 193.7547\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_242-release-1644-b01)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n",
