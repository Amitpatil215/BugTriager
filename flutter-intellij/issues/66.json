All non-mirrors dart code works in just the same in `sky_shell` so one could always use `sky_shell`.  IntelliJ could also tell which test needed which based on it being a flutter project vs. a dart project, or if we put one typ of test in a different directory.  It's also possible from analyzing the code to know if it depends on dart:ui or not.\n\n`flutter test` is just a wrapper around `package:test`'s standard runner, that knows how to sub in `sky_shell` instead of `dart`. :)\n",
