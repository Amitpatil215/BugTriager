Why do I have to configure the Android Framework after the project was created? Shouldn't this be automatic or questioned at the Wizard?\r\n\r\n2. Why there's no Dart framework detected and I have to dig into the Flutter SDK files to find it?\r\n\r\n3. Just take a look at the Flutter logo on the Root of the project, as soon as I configure the Android Framework, it's gone (to be seen soon).\r\n\r\nSo, lets continue then. \r\n\r\nI will add the Dart SDK, this is what I have now:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8120472/54646031-9e13ab00-4a7c-11e9-80c6-5445d43aa227.png)\r\n\r\nThis is what I get after searching inside the Flutter SDK folders for a while:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8120472/54646057-b4ba0200-4a7c-11e9-8013-8a7762e38dce.png)\r\n\r\nWhich is curious, because it says I am using Dart version 2.2.0, but `flutter --version` says I am using Dart 2.1.2, so I guess I have no clue where to find the actual Dart SDK then.\r\n\r\nThen I click to add the Android Framework that was automatically detected and this pops up:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8120472/54646149-f8ad0700-4a7c-11e9-8bd2-1c6da491c7ed.png)\r\n\r\nAnd now the Flutter logo on the Root on my project is gone! Why?\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8120472/54646161-06628c80-4a7d-11e9-85fe-ce0700539a38.png)\r\n\r\nThis is my module settings with the Android Framework configured:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8120472/54646207-242ff180-4a7d-11e9-920f-9446fdddaaa9.png)\r\n\r\nAll looks good....But, this is the project configuration:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8120472/54646230-33af3a80-4a7d-11e9-8e0a-0e65aa59d74c.png)\r\n\r\nWhich shows no SDK for the project.\r\n\r\n(one time I had this `out` folder vanish in another project and I had to add it again to the project's configuration).\r\n\r\nSo, if I start an Android Emulator and try to run it like this, I get this error:\r\n\r\n>Launching lib\\main.dart on Android SDK built for x86 64 in debug mode...\r\nInitializing gradle...\r\nCreateProcessW failed 193\r\nFinished with error: ProcessException: %1 is not a valid Win32 application.\r\n>\r\n>Command: C:\\Users\\Michel Feinstein\\Desktop\\newProjectTest\\new_project_test\\android\\gradlew.bat -v \r\n\r\nWhich I had to google to find out that this is what you get when there's a space in your project's path (maybe add a hint when this error occurs, like `hey do you have an space on your path?` or warn users when there's a space in their path, or just make it work with spaces?).\r\n\r\nAnd then it compiles, installs and works.\r\n\r\nSo, this is my experience when I create a new Flutter project in IntelliJ IDEA, I think there's a lot of room for improvement.\r\n\r\nThis is my `flutter doctor -v`:\r\n\r\n> \r\n> [√] Flutter (Channel stable, v1.2.1, on Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.17763.379], locale pt-BR)\r\n>     • Flutter version 1.2.1 at C:\\Programacao\\Flutter\\sdk\\flutter\r\n>     • Framework revision 8661d8aecd (5 weeks ago), 2019-02-14 19:19:53 -0800\r\n>     • Engine revision 3757390fa4\r\n>     • Dart version 2.1.2 (build 2.1.2-dev.0.0 0a7dcf17eb)\r\n> \r\n> [√] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 28.0.3)\r\n>     • Android SDK at C:\\Programacao\\Android\\Sdk\r\n>     • Android NDK location not configured (optional; useful for native profiling support)\r\n>     • Platform android-28, build-tools 28.0.3\r\n>     • Java binary at: C:\\Program Files\\Android\\Android Studio\\jre\\bin\\java\r\n>     • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_152-release-1248-b01)\r\n>     • All Android licenses accepted.\r\n> \r\n> [√] Android Studio (version 3.3)\r\n>     • Android Studio at C:\\Program Files\\Android\\Android Studio\r\n>     • Flutter plugin version 33.4.1\r\n>     • Dart plugin version 182.5215\r\n>     • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_152-release-1248-b01)\r\n> \r\n> [!] IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition (version 2018.2)\r\n>     • IntelliJ at C:\\Program Files\\JetBrains\\IntelliJ IDEA 2018.1.5\r\n>     X Flutter plugin not installed; this adds Flutter specific functionality.\r\n>     X Dart plugin not installed; this adds Dart specific functionality.\r\n>     • For information about installing plugins, see\r\n>       https://flutter.io/intellij-setup/#installing-the-plugins\r\n> \r\n> [√] IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition (version 2018.3)\r\n>     • IntelliJ at C:\\Program Files\\JetBrains\\IntelliJ IDEA 2018.3\r\n>     • Flutter plugin version 33.4.2\r\n>     • Dart plugin version 183.5912.23\r\n> \r\n> [√] VS Code (version 1.32.1)\r\n>     • VS Code at C:\\Users\\Michel Feinstein\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Microsoft VS Code\r\n>     • Flutter extension version 2.24.0\r\n> \r\n> [!] Connected device\r\n>     !
