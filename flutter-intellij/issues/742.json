I expected to see the names that I picked in avd when I created these emulators.\r\n\r\nLooking at the FlutterDevice class, it appears we display whatever is in myDeviceName, which is populated from the \"name\" field sent by the \"flutter daemon\" command. So, getting a useful name back probably requires modifying flutter.\r\n\r\nA workaround might be to display myDeviceId if that's necessary to distinguish them. But this isn't so useful either; in this case the ids are \"emulator-5554\" and \"emulator-5556\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
