It appears to be controlled by the ToolWindowManager section of the workspace config file (.idea/workspace.xml). Try comparing the workspace config files of your two projects and changing the one that does not include logcat to include it like the newer one does. You might get it enabled by deleting the workspace config file, but make a backup in case it doesn't work.",
