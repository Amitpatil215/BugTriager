I have a [CL](https://codereview.chromium.org/2411153002/) that will land shortly that will add an optional `pause` parameter to `reloadSources`. When set to `true`, the isolate will pause in the debug loop. While the isolate is paused, debug clients can issue any service requests including `addBreakpoint`. Once a client has updated the state, it can resume the isolate.\n\nI would expect this structure would allow you to reuse the code that runs at isolate startup for registering breakpoints.\n\nSimilarly, the daemon's `app.restart` should probably be expanded to support requesting the application be 'paused' after the restart so that more operations can be performed before execution resumes.\n",
