Command-O always gives \"No methods were found to override\". Typing the first few letters of what I want to override and then hitting Ctrl-Space does give me some override suggestions, but then I have to know the exact name (or at least the beginning) of the override, and often I just want to see what is overridable before I pick one.\r\n\r\nIt would be really nice if Ctrl-Space in a blank area would give me a list of all the possible overrides, and that Command-O was wired up to do the right thing instead of trying to list Java methods or whatever it is doing.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I would like to suggest that the templates that the override suggestions place do NOT include the comment that says `// TODO: implement <function>`, since 99.9% of the time I just immediately delete it, making it more work to do (EDIT: actually 100% of the time, since it doesn't match our TODO style guide requirement).  I feel the same way about the \"throw UnimplementedError\" lines too: I'd rather it insert non-functional code than make me delete it every single time.  Alternatively, once inserted, it could automatically select the body of the function so I could just immediately hit delete or start typing to delete the `throw` line. I still wouldn't want the TODO comments though.",
