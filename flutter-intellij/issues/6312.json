Another way is just pressing the `View` button to get the object's toString() output.\r\n\r\nHowever, the debugger cuts this information short, probably to save memory?\r\n\r\nFor example, this is the `View` output for a variable called `someObjectWithInformati`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsomeObjectWithInformati{cliente: null, empresa: null, parceira: null, dayHourMin: 2022-09-18T00:00:00.000Z, agd: null, colabs: P\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's only 128 chars. If, however, I add a watcher for `someObjectWithInformati.toString()` then I get the complete output:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsomeObjectWithInformati{cliente: null, empresa: null, parceira: null, dayHourMin: 2022-09-18T00:00:00.000Z, \r\nagd: null, colabs: ParticipantesIds {|colabsPorEmpresa: { }  IMapOfSetsConst<EmpresaId, PessoaId>|pessoasAvulsas: { }\r\nISetConst<PessoaId>|confirmacoes: { }  IMapConst<PessoaId, Confirmacao>|}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe whole point of the debugger is making it easy for us to debug. Cutting the information short to save a few bytes of memory in 2022 makes little sense. It forces me to create whatchers adding `toString()` everywhere, or else inspect through the properties where a single glance to the `View` output would suffice.\r\n\r\nPlease let this information contain the complete `toString()` output. At least the Watch tab should contain complete outputs, but ideally everywhere.\r\n\r\nIf you absolutely must have a limit there, please make if 100kb instead of only 128 chars. \r\n   \r\n",

That's the `presentableValue` variable. But the code on line 205 changes it to use the full string length. I stepped through with the debugger and can confirm that line 205 does get executed. Apparently, the condition on line 204 evaluates to `false` for you but I don't know why that would happen. That test extracts a value from the JSON sent from the VM.\r\n\r\nThese screen shots were a debugging session using a variable in the `Variables` pane. But the same thing happens when I use the `Watches` pane. Both run through line 205. Is there anything else about your setup that might be unique? I'm pretty sure I have not customized anything (but could have forgotten something). I'm using Flutter 3.3.2.\r\n\r\n@bkonyi Do you have any insights about what might be happening here?",
