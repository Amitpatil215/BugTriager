I have two follow-up questions.\r\n\r\nFirst, can you give me more information about this symptom?\r\n> 'Flutter SDK PATH' cannot be identified.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what that means. Another screen shot would probably help.\r\n\r\nSecond, since MacOS treats ~/Library specially, could you try installing the Flutter SDK in a different place, just to see if Flutter is getting tripped up by the special directory?",
