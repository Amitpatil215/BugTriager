Does the option you show above include things like the VM Service and Flutter Run JSON?\r\n\r\nIn case it's of interest, the VS Code command (**Dart: Capture Logs**) lets the user choose which things to log (like the JSON to Analyzer, Flutter Run, Flutter Test, Observatory, and other processes Dart Code spawns) and then just writes combined logs for them to a single temp file. It shows a notification in the corner that logs are being gathered, and once the user has repro'd their issue they click **Stop Logging** and it opens up the log file for them to copy/paste/save. It's a great way to get a short log with just the useful info for a bug (previously I'd get thousands of lines of Analyzer log just to debug a single tooltip, for example!).\r\n",
