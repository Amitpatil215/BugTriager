I was using Flutter 2.2.1 which was a little bit slow but 2.5 is making intellisense and code completion unusable (its easier to type in the results). I do have a large project but it was kind of ok previously.\r\n\r\nJust to say that my problem was mostly remedied after I allocated more memory to IntelliJ ```InteliJ IDEA CE.app.vmoptions```, I was previously using the default options which might not be recommended.  Possibly my problem is different to the OP's problem.  Could 2.5 use more memory?  Good news is everything is ok enough for me, still a tiny lag but one that doesn't bother me.",

I was using Flutter 2.2.1 which was a little bit slow but 2.5 is making intellisense and code completion unusable (its easier to type in the results). I do have a large project but it was kind of ok previously.\r\n> \r\n> Just to say that my problem was mostly remedied after I allocated more memory to IntelliJ `InteliJ IDEA CE.app.vmoptions`, I was previously using the default options which might not be recommended. Possibly my problem is different to the OP's problem. Could 2.5 use more memory? Good news is everything is ok enough for me, still a tiny lag but one that doesn't bother me.\r\n\r\n@atreeon how much? I've got 8GB allocated, of which only 1 is used, and it's just as slow as shown in the videos above",
