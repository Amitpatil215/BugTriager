    "body": "Hey, I really don't like that now the Android emulator is now always inside an IntelliJ window, with a lot of useless (to me) buttons and information. It was not broken before, and I don't see the current situation as an improvement. Also:\r\n\r\n* The scaling has no anti-alias, making it very ugly when the window is small. \r\n* The zoom controls are overlapping the phone screen, forcing us to make the window larger to avoid the overlap. And then the window gets bigger and wastes a lot of screen space.\r\n\r\nCould you please let us open the emulator just as before, as one of the options? Let's call it a \"plain mode\". As a simple window, with no opinionated bells and whistles. Thank you!",
