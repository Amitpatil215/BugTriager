This was not happening in the previous version and happening only on the inspector tab. PLEASE HELP.\r\n\r\n- What you think the correct behavior should be.\r\n\r\nIt should be like always the UI is docked on the tab like the Outline and Performance tabs\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24521000/99353641-98074a80-28ad-11eb-9655-7d94a2609b7f.png)\r\n",
