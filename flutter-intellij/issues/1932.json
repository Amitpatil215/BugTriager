I think the Outline view should be simple enough that a developer can glance it for less than a minute and then understand what the widget structure of a new app is, i.e.:\r\n\r\n* One stateless widget building an app and a home page\r\n* One stateful widget building a Scaffold with three main parts, and with the main part having a centered column containing two texts\r\n\r\nI would speculate that any information shown that doesn't speak to that structure is \"noise\" and detracts from that goal. And then only additional thing I would add, is that I actually with you could see the difference between stateless and stateful widgets.\r\n\r\n",
