If your issue is related to the Flutter framework itself,\r\nplease open an issue at\r\n[github.com/flutter/flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/new).\r\n\r\n### Issue Type: Bug.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n1. Open a flutter project in VS Code.\r\n2. Open the Command Pallet( Control+Shift+P).\r\n3. Select Flutter: Select Device.\r\n4. Create an Android Emulator from Android AVD images(if haven't already).\r\n5. Choose an Android emulator.\r\n6. Wait till the emulator starts.\r\n7. The emulator cannot be minimized.\r\n\r\n### Even if I start the emulator with **flutter emulators --launch flutter_emulator**\r\n\r\nProof: \r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79036875/180995750-ebfc8023-063e-4aba-b3a4-90a2ff07d676.mp4\r\n\r\n### Even if I try to do it with cmd then also the problem persists:\r\n\r\n1. Run flutter config --machine.\r\n2. Find android-sdk path.\r\n3. Run /home/shlok/Android/Sdk/emulator/emulator -avd flutter_emulator but replace /home/shlok/Android/Sdk/ with the android-sdk path and flutter_emulator with the emulator name.\r\n\r\n## What I expected to happen:\r\n\r\n1. Emulator should minimize when pressing the minimize button.\r\n\r\n## What actually happens:\r\n\r\n1. The emulator minimizes and opens automatically although it should have been minimized.\r\n\r\n## Proof: \r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79036875/180995369-74a823de-2787-4c33-8439-85f159eb7ab6.mp4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<summary>System Info</summary>\r\n\r\n|Item|Value|\r\n|---|---|\r\n|CPUs|AMD Ryzen 5 3550H with Radeon Vega Mobile Gfx (8 x 1400)|\r\n|GPU Status|2d_canvas: enabled<br>canvas_oop_rasterization: disabled_off<br>direct_rendering_display_compositor: disabled_off_ok<br>gpu_compositing: enabled<br>multiple_raster_threads: enabled_on<br>opengl: enabled_on<br>rasterization: enabled<br>raw_draw: disabled_off_ok<br>skia_renderer: enabled_on<br>video_decode: disabled_software<br>video_encode: disabled_software<br>vulkan: disabled_off<br>webgl: enabled<br>webgl2: enabled|\r\n|Load (avg)|2, 1, 1|\r\n|Memory (System)|5.73GB (0.12GB free)|\r\n|Process Argv|--no-sandbox . --crash-reporter-id ac2a9ee4-7023-4d78-be8f-230bafddad07|\r\n|Screen Reader|no|\r\n|VM|0%|\r\n|DESKTOP_SESSION|ubuntu|\r\n|XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP|Unity|\r\n|XDG_SESSION_DESKTOP|ubuntu|\r\n|XDG_SESSION_TYPE|x11|\r\n</details><details>\r\n<summary>A/B Experiments</summary>\r\n\r\n```\r\nvsliv368cf:30146710\r\nvsreu685:30147344\r\npython383cf:30185419\r\nvspor879:30202332\r\nvspor708:30202333\r\nvspor363:30204092\r\nvswsl492:30256859\r\nvslsvsres303:30308271\r\npythonvspyl392:30443607\r\nvserr242:30382549\r\npythontb:30283811\r\nvsjup518:30340749\r\npythonvspyt551cf:30345471\r\npythonptprofiler:30281270\r\nvshan820:30294714\r\nvstes263:30335439\r\nvscorecescf:30445987\r\npythondataviewer:30285071\r\nvscod805:30301674\r\nbinariesv615:30325510\r\nbridge0708:30335490\r\nbridge0723:30353136\r\ncmake_vspar411:30525688\r\nvsaa593cf:30376535\r\nvsc1dst:30438360\r\npythonvs932:30410667\r\nwslgetstarted:30449410\r\nvscscmwlcmt:30465135\r\ncppdebug:30492333\r\npylanb8912:30529769\r\nvsclangdf:30486550\r\n841h4636:30532337\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79036875/180786514-07770184-eed9-4556-886b-dff280ebda33.mp4\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79036875/180784347-ace407c5-2ce2-40ad-a896-6b92d1bf0538.png)\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by issue reporter -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Version info\r\n\r\nPlease paste the output of running `flutter doctor -v` here (available from the command\r\nline or from `Tools > Flutter > Flutter Doctor`).
