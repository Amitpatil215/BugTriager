If your issue is related to the Flutter framework itself,\r\nplease open an issue at\r\n[github.com/flutter/flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/new).\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Running Android Studio on Mac\r\n1. Change Dart SDK from flutter installed version to Homebrew installed 2.2.0. Click Apply and then OK.\r\n1. After some time, maybe restart the IDE, notice that the `skip` parameter for a test method is not recognized as defined.\r\n1. I will go to the settings and see that either the Dart SDK reverts back to the version used by flutter and/or the Flutter SDK is set as empty or undefined.\r\n\r\nManually changing the Dart SDK back to the version used by flutter may not correct the issue seen in the IDE. Going back to the setting, the Flutter SDK may have been changed by the IDE/plugin or the Dart SDK is re-set to the non-flutter installed version.\r\n\r\nIt's very hard to understand the logic. For the Dart SDK, I may even set it to look for updates on the Stable channel only and even that would get undone when the Dart SDK gets auto changed.\r\n\r\n\r\nLook at the following screenshots (look at the time stamps to see how quickly the settings change on their own.\r\n\r\n*  at 6:11:57 PM\r\n<img width=\"909\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-03-20 at 6:11:57 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7527155/54723282-805a4a80-4b3d-11e9-841b-5aa289e3968b.png\">\r\n\r\n *  at 6:12:06 PM\r\n<img width=\"644\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-03-20 at 6:12:06 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7527155/54723283-805a4a80-4b3d-11e9-94af-ec5f8ef42390.png\">\r\n\r\n* at 6:12:18 PM I changed the Flutter SDK\r\n<img width=\"672\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-03-20 at 6:12:18 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7527155/54723285-805a4a80-4b3d-11e9-9c01-6f8e11834a9d.png\">\r\n\r\n* at 6:12:43 PM, noticed it had no impact and the IDE still reported the same issue (`skip` not defined)\r\n<img width=\"353\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-03-20 at 6:12:43 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7527155/54723287-80f2e100-4b3d-11e9-87f8-a6084f58289a.png\">\r\n\r\n* at 6:12:51 PM - Flutter remains unchanged\r\n<img width=\"591\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-03-20 at 6:12:51 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7527155/54723288-80f2e100-4b3d-11e9-9535-591e8431af62.png\">\r\n\r\n* at 6:12:59 PM - The Dart SDK setting changed with no user input\r\n<img width=\"758\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-03-20 at 6:12:59 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7527155/54723289-80f2e100-4b3d-11e9-9fff-553424d9fbb4.png\">\r\n\r\n* at 6:13:27 PM - Flutter is set as empty/undefined with no user input\r\n<img width=\"741\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-03-20 at 6:13:27 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7527155/54723290-80f2e100-4b3d-11e9-94e5-6467d330e7aa.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n## Version info\r\nflutter doctor --verbose\r\n[✓] Flutter (Channel stable, v1.2.1, on Mac OS X 10.14.3 18D109, locale en-US)\r\n    • Flutter version 1.2.1 at /Users/User/flutter\r\n    • Framework revision 8661d8aecd (5 weeks ago), 2019-02-14 19:19:53 -0800\r\n    • Engine revision 3757390fa4\r\n    • Dart version 2.1.2 (build 2.1.2-dev.0.0 0a7dcf17eb)\r\n\r\n[✓] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 28.0.3)\r\n    • Android SDK at /Users/User/Library/Android/sdk\r\n    • Android NDK location not configured (optional; useful for native profiling support)\r\n    • Platform android-28, build-tools 28.0.3\r\n    • Java binary at: /Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jre/jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_152-release-1248-b01)\r\n    • All Android licenses accepted.\r\n\r\n[✓] iOS toolchain - develop for iOS devices (Xcode 10.1)\r\n    • Xcode at /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer\r\n    • Xcode 10.1, Build version 10B61\r\n    • ios-deploy 1.9.4\r\n    • CocoaPods version 1.6.1\r\n\r\n[✓] Android Studio (version 3.3)\r\n    • Android Studio at /Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents\r\n    • Flutter plugin version 33.4.1\r\n    • Dart plugin version 182.5215\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_152-release-1248-b01)\r\n\r\n[✓] IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition (version 2018.3.5)\r\n    • IntelliJ at /Applications/IntelliJ IDEA.app\r\n    • Flutter plugin version 30.0.2\r\n    • Dart plugin version 183.5912.23\r\n\r\n[!] Connected device\r\n    !

I don't know how you would do that, but it does seem like it happened, from the version solving problem. Here's something that might work.\r\n\r\nOpen the preferences/settings for the Dart plugin. Clear the Dart SDK field and save. Then open settings/preferences for the Flutter plugin. Clear the Flutter SDK field and apply changes (you may have to save and re-open, not sure). Delete your Flutter SDK and re-install it to restore the embedded Dart SDK. Then set the Flutter SDK field to the new Flutter SDK. That will reset the Dart SDK to the one embedded in Flutter.",
