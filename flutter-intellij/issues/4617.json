The FAQ linked above has a link to an article by the author of `dartfmt` about how it is implemented. No one on the Dart or Flutter teams has the time to write and maintain another formatter.\r\n\r\nThat all sounds good in theory, but my experience with flutter plugins is: it uses (and forces on contributors) their own formatting, incompatible with dartfmt.\r\nDouble frustrating.\r\nI wonder how you could justify both at the same time. (I understand that `flutter/plugins != flutter/flutter-intellij` but they're both flutter, and you kinda speak on their behalf, right?)\r\nCherry on the cake: the integrated flutter plugin tool that's supposed to format the source code _flutter-way_, always crashes on Windows. I filed a bug about that a while ago, which just hangs there with no fix.\r\nFrom the point of view of an ISV this formatting dogma makes no sense and only serves to cause pain and frustration.",

They might have never used an IDE before too. So you kinda achieved that noble goal, getting all those folks automatically formatting their code from now on. \r\n\r\nBut I personally, coming from 'developed' languages and IDE's, have my own ideas about code formatting that I did not invent myself, but learned from other, more distinguished figures. You say that none have the time to maintain another formatter, but the plugins repo actually maintains one, not mentioning that someone at some point in the past decided they have plenty of time to bother with dartfmt to start with, with no way to opt out. Every now and then, when I look at dartfmt output, it hurts.\r\n\r\nI wonder if you want to live in a world where all houses look identical, and cars, etc. You know, to improve the quality of ecosystem, and so on.",

I wonder how much of their own preference they are used to be giving up regularly. The default rules of dartfmt weren't written on stone tablets by a deity. Someone like you and me was allowed (or probably self-appointed) to very much indulge in their individual preference when they wrote that dartfmt draft, weren't they? Of course, under condition that absolutely everybody else was now given no choice but give up their own individual preference.\r\n\r\nYou don't see the irony in that? Nor historical precedence?",

In any given book I expect the formatting to be consistent throughout.

There is no issue of giving up choice. You can write your own formatter or do manual formatting.\r\n\r\nAs I said before, no one on the Dart or Flutter teams is going to write another formatter.
