This should print out something like:\r\n```\r\n[{\"event\":\"daemon.connected\",\"params\":{\"version\":\"0.6.0\",\"pid\":60943}}]\r\n[{\"event\":\"daemon.logMessage\",\"params\":{\"level\":\"status\",\"message\":\"Starting device daemon...\"}}]\r\n```\r\nand the process will wait for input\r\n2. Type `[{\"id\":1,\"method\":\"device.enable\"}]` After a bit, you should see lines like:\r\n```\r\n[{\"id\":1}]\r\n[{\"event\":\"device.added\",\"params\":{\"id\":\"chrome\",\"name\":\"Chrome\",\"platform\":\"web-javascript\",\"emulator\":false,\"category\":\"web\",\"platformType\":\"web\",\"ephemeral\":false,\"emulatorId\":null}}]\r\n[{\"event\":\"device.added\",\"params\":{\"id\":\"287E1F39-AE03-44BD-ACDB-7F668B1E32EA\",\"name\":\"iPhone SE (2nd generation)\",\"platform\":\"ios\",\"emulator\":true,\"category\":\"mobile\",\"platformType\":\"ios\",\"ephemeral\":true,\"emulatorId\":\"apple_ios_simulator\"}}]\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom your logs, only Chrome was returned as a device, but I wonder if you get a different result in your terminal. If you continue to get only Chrome in your terminal, then I think there may be an issue in flutter that causes `flutter devices` to return different results than `flutter daemon`.\r\n\r\nAnother thing you could try is adding an Android emulator (I think you have a real device connected?) and seeing if this shows up in IntelliJ.",

It looks like from your IDE logs that the same command is being used. Sorry this is not apparent.\r\n\r\nOne more thing you could try is disabling web by calling on command line: `flutter config --no-enable-web` (you can later reverse this with `flutter config --enable-web`. This should remove Chrome from your list of devices (e.g. if you try `flutter devices`). Then you can restart your IDE and get logs the same way as before. I'm suggesting this in case there's a problem with the plugin processing multiple devices or if somehow the environment is different within the plugin.",
