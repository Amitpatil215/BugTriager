    "body": "If you try to invoke code completion on Widgets' Constructors Named Parameters, you get a suggestion list that you can filter by:\r\n\r\n- Alphabetically ( useful only if you DO REMEMBER what you have to complete the code with )\r\n\r\n- by Relevance ( I wonder... how this \"relevance\" is being generated ? Randomly ? :grin: )\r\n\r\nLet's make some examples. I expect to have INTELLIJ suggesting me:\r\n\r\nfor **Padding:**:\r\n- EdgeInsets.only\r\n- EdgeInsets.all\r\n- ... and so on\r\n\r\nfor **Decoration:** (inside a Container)\r\n- BoxDecoration\r\n- ... and so on\r\n\r\nfor **Decoration:** (inside a Textfield)\r\n- InputDecoration\r\n- ... and so on\r\n\r\nfor **Margin:**\r\n- EdgeInsets.only\r\n- EdgeInsets.all\r\n- ... and so on\r\n\r\nInstead, now, regardless of the named parameter you're trying to complete, we got:\r\n\r\n**Build (BuildContext context)\r\nnew\r\nthis\r\nfalse\r\nnull**\r\n\r\nWhat are these actually useful for ? You aren't going to complete your code with them. They're like \"noise\" for you... while you're trying to remember what you must put there in your code.\r\n\r\nSo, right now, code-completion for many named parameters, is almost completely useless, or at least, it's very very inefficient.\r\n\r\nI think a named-parameters-aware-auto-completion would lead to:\r\n\r\n- FASTER CODING\r\n- HELPING ( especially beginners ) to remember things, speeding up the steep learning curve\r\n- OPTIMIZE TIME, avoiding hours spent bouncing back and forth between IDE and API Docs\r\n\r\nSo, i wonder, isn't there a way to prioritize the useful auto-completion results and list them by REAL EFFECTIVE USEFULNESS ? In such a way that the auto completion suggests you the things that are compatible / pertinent to the code where you invoked it.\r\n\r\nPlease someone let me know. Thank you !\r\n\r\n( @scheglov sorry for the disturb, I mention you because I just did a search and i found this: https://github.com/flutter/flutter-intellij/issues/998 ... but as I can see things are still unchanged since last year. Is anyone taking this topic forward ? )",
