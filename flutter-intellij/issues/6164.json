If you don't\r\n///    know about the [String] class, you've not been paying attention.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you paste this into IntelliJ, it will linkify the first instance of `[String]`, but not the second one. It seems that any reference on the subsequent lines of a bulleted list are not recognized as being symbols, probably because the parser is assuming that any line beginning with three spaces is a &lt;pre&gt; section in Markdown.  I think it's supposed to be four or more, really, but only if it's not part of a bulleted or numbered list. Maybe that's not the cause, but in any case, it doesn't work.\r\n\r\nAnd it's not just linking: rename operations on any symbol that isn't recognized in this way will also fail: it'll skip renaming those symbols referenced in subsequent lines of the list.\r\n\r\n## Version info\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>flutter doctor -v</summary>\r\n[âœ“] Flutter (Channel shortcuts_registry, 3.1.0-0.0.pre.671, on Debian GNU/Linux rodete 5.16.18-1rodete2-amd64, locale en_US.UTF-8)\r\n    â€¢ Flutter version 3.1.0-0.0.pre.671 at /usr/local/google/home/gspencer/code/flutter\r\n    â€¢ Upstream repository git@github.com:gspencergoog/flutter.git\r\n    â€¢ Framework revision 4aaaa5a9ba (7 minutes ago), 2022-05-13 09:22:43 -0700\r\n    â€¢ Engine revision b8ca6a5e0e\r\n    â€¢ Dart version 2.18.0 (build 2.18.0-106.0.dev)\r\n    â€¢ DevTools version 2.13.1\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 32.1.0-rc1)\r\n    â€¢ Android SDK at /usr/local/google/home/gspencer/Android/Sdk\r\n    â€¢ Platform android-32, build-tools 32.1.0-rc1\r\n    â€¢ ANDROID_HOME = /usr/local/google/home/gspencer/Android/Sdk\r\n    â€¢ Java binary at: /usr/local/google/home/gspencer/Android/android-studio/jre/bin/java\r\n    â€¢ Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.11+0-b60-7590822)\r\n    â€¢ All Android licenses accepted.\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Chrome - develop for the web\r\n    â€¢ Chrome at google-chrome\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Linux toolchain - develop for Linux desktop\r\n    â€¢ Debian clang version 13.0.1-3+build2\r\n    â€¢ cmake version 3.22.1\r\n    â€¢ ninja version 1.8.2\r\n    â€¢ pkg-config version 0.29.2\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Android Studio (version 2021.1)\r\n    â€¢ Android Studio at /usr/local/google/home/gspencer/Android/android-studio\r\n    â€¢ Flutter plugin can be installed from:\r\n      ðŸ”¨ https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9212-flutter\r\n    â€¢ Dart plugin can be installed from:\r\n      ðŸ”¨ https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6351-dart\r\n    â€¢ Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.11+0-b60-7590822)\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Android Studio\r\n    â€¢ Android Studio at /opt/android-studio\r\n    â€¢ Flutter plugin can be installed from:\r\n      ðŸ”¨ https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9212-flutter\r\n    â€¢ Dart plugin can be installed from:\r\n      ðŸ”¨ https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6351-dart\r\n    â€¢ Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_242-release-1644-b3-6222593)\r\n\r\n[âœ“] IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition (version 2022.1)\r\n    â€¢ IntelliJ at /opt/idea-IC-212.4746.92\r\n    â€¢ Flutter plugin version 67.1.4\r\n    â€¢ Dart plugin version 221.5588\r\n\r\n[âœ“] Connected device (2 available)\r\n    â€¢ Linux (desktop) â€¢ linux  â€¢ linux-x64      â€¢ Debian GNU/Linux rodete 5.16.18-1rodete2-amd64\r\n    â€¢ Chrome (web)    â€¢ chrome â€¢ web-javascript â€¢ Google Chrome 101.0.4951.64\r\n\r\n[âœ“] HTTP Host Availability\r\n    â€¢ All required HTTP hosts are available\r\n\r\nâ€¢ No issues found!\r\n</details>\r\n",
