This is determined by this method: https://github.com/flutter/flutter-intellij/blob/023e41ea0e73da77c33874366287f8f2b8d82c18/src/io/flutter/utils/FlutterModuleUtils.java#L74\r\n\r\nThis particular project is a multi module project, with this structure:\r\n\r\n```\r\nroot_folder\r\n\t/src\r\n\t\t/client\r\n\t\t\t/app - flutter app\r\n\t\t\t/packages\r\n\t\t\t\t\t/package1 - flutter package\r\n\t\t\t\t\t/package2 - flutter package\r\n\t\t\t\r\n```\r\n\r\nI guess since the root_folder is not a dart/flutter module it's not detecting this project as a Flutter project.\r\n\r\n@helin24 do you have any ideas of how to solve this or does the new tool window logic need to be reverted?
