Create a class property that has the similar name of the class eg.: `final itemController = ItemController();`\r\n2. Somewhere inside that class start typing the class name using the correct casing eg.: `var example = Item`\r\n3. Watch the autocompletion grab the class property first instead of respecting the casing of what you're typing.\r\n\r\n![2020-07-15_08-56-08](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16387107/87553880-11312f80-c679-11ea-87e4-ffb58390c3d5.gif)\r\n\r\n## Setting expectation\r\n\r\nI want it to take into consideration the capitalization when ordering items in the auto-complete list displays. So if I want to autocomplete the class name and I start it with PascalCase it looks for the class name first not the class variable with the same name.\r\n\r\n## Version info\r\n\r\n[√] Flutter (Channel stable, v1.17.4, on Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.18362.900], locale en-US)\r\n    • Flutter version 1.17.4 at D:\\flutter\r\n    • Framework revision 1ad9baa8b9 (4 weeks ago), 2020-06-17 14:41:16 -0700\r\n    • Engine revision ee76268252\r\n    • Dart version 2.8.4\r\n\r\n\r\n[√] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 30.0.0)\r\n    • Android SDK at D:\\Android\\sdk\r\n    • Platform android-29, build-tools 30.0.0\r\n    • ANDROID_HOME = D:\\Android\\sdk\r\n    • Java binary at: D:\\Program Files\\JetBrains\\apps\\AndroidStudio\\ch-0\\193.6626763\\jre\\bin\\java\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_242-release-1644-b01)\r\n    • All Android licenses accepted.\r\n\r\n[√] Android Studio (version 3.6)\r\n    • Android Studio at D:\\Program Files\\JetBrains\\apps\\AndroidStudio\\ch-0\\192.6392135\r\n    • Flutter plugin version 36.1.1\r\n    • Dart plugin version 183.6270\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_212-release-1586-b04)\r\n\r\n[!] Android Studio (version 4.0)\r\n    • Android Studio at D:\\Program Files\\JetBrains\\apps\\AndroidStudio\\ch-0\\193.6626763\r\n    X Flutter plugin not installed; this adds Flutter specific functionality.\r\n    X Dart plugin not installed; this adds Dart specific functionality.\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_242-release-1644-b01)\r\n\r\n\r\nNot sure why Android Studio 4 is saying the plugin isn't installed.
