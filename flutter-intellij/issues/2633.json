    "body": "@terrylucas who has some pointers on how this could be supported.\r\nThe Android Studio style tooltips would be great in the inspector as well as the Memory performance view. The big benefit of these tooltips is they display immediately on mouse over and move with the cursor. Tooltips showing renders of the current widget, dart docs for properties and more in the inspector would be great. User studies have suggested that the existing tooltips are hard for users to notice and hard to trigger.\r\n\r\nWe should write the code so we fall back gracefully to regular tooltips onside of Android Studio or port the tooltip library so it can be used outside of Android Studio.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"234\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-09-28 at 8 45 46 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1226812/46219026-146bf780-c2fb-11e8-9602-5da64704bb18.png\">\r\n",
