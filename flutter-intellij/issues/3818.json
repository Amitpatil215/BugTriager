    "body": "## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Start writing any of the widgets that take a closure (`AnimatedBuilder`, `StreamBuilder`, `FutureBuilder`, `ListView.builder`, `LayoutBuilder`, `CupertinoTabScaffold`, etc.).\r\n2. Check parameters (Cmd-P). Notice how the closure doesn't have any type information. Even if it did, it would be something like `IndexedWidgetBuilder` or `TransitionBuilder` or `ControlsWidgetBuilder`, which doesn't make it obvious what the parameters are. (The only immediately obvious to me is `VoidCallback` but that's learned.)\r\n\r\n    ![Screen Shot 2019-08-26 at 5 44 09 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/919717/63732653-1a7b9880-c82a-11e9-9024-2c77e0c27bb4.png)\r\n\r\n3. Start writing the widget arguments. Here, _if you remember not to tab-complete immediately_, you can see what the closure should look like. To be honest, the first time I noticed that is today, when documenting this user journey.\r\n\r\n    ![Screen Shot 2019-08-26 at 5 44 32 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/919717/63732692-4f87eb00-c82a-11e9-9c4a-0767750503d2.png)\r\n\r\n4. After you tab-complete and have `builder: ` (or `onTap: ` or whatever), now you can access the signature of the closure anymore. Cmd-P gives back the untyped view:\r\n\r\n    ![Screen Shot 2019-08-26 at 5 44 42 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/919717/63732727-76462180-c82a-11e9-844a-8a04416add94.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nSorted by desirability, ascending:\r\n\r\nA) The typedef of the closure is shown in the Cmd-P window.\r\n\r\nB) The full signature of the closure is shown in the Cmd-P window.\r\n\r\nC) The closure is written for me, and the cursor gets transported inside the body. For example, in the `AnimatedBuilder` example above, I write `builder: ` and `(context, child) {}` is written. The arguments are named after the typedef signature.\r\n\r\nD) Same as above, but the closure is only _suggested_, so I can provide a member method instead of writing inline, without first deleting the auto-completion.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Version info\r\n\r\nPlease paste the output of running `flutter doctor -v` here (available from the command\r\nline or from `Tools > Flutter > Flutter Doctor`).
