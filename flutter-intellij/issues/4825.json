    "body": "I have a Flutter project that's within a Bazel directory. It's not built by Bazel in any way, but it happens to be in a monorepo that uses Bazel for most other things.\r\n\r\nRunning and debugging from within Android Studio used to work fine, but is now broken. Trying to launch `main.dart` results in an error:\r\n\r\n> Entrypoint isn't within a Flutter pub root.\r\n\r\nLooking at **Preferences > Languages & Frameworks > Flutter** shows that the Flutter SDK path has changed to `/Users/rohan/tidbyt/null <set by bazel project>`. That isn't a valid path on my machine. Resetting the setting here doesn't seem to do anything.\r\n\r\nI have a hunch that this is related to #4735 (/cc @helin24 @jacob314). My guess is that that broke the IntelliJ plugin for Flutter projects in Bazel directories outside of Google.\r\n\r\n# Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Have a Flutter project that's inside a Bazel workspace. (not at Google)\r\n2. Try to run the project from within Android Studio\r\n\r\n## Version info\r\n\r\n```\r\n[✓] Flutter (Channel unknown, 1.20.2, on Mac OS X 10.15.6 19G2021, locale en-US)\r\n    • Flutter version 1.20.2 at /opt/flutter\r\n    • Framework revision bbfbf1770c (5 weeks ago), 2020-08-13 08:33:09 -0700\r\n    • Engine revision 9d5b21729f\r\n    • Dart version 2.9.1\r\n\r\n[!] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 29.0.3)\r\n    • Android SDK at /Users/rohan/Library/Android/sdk\r\n    • Platform android-29, build-tools 29.0.3\r\n    • Java binary at: /Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jre/jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_242-release-1644-b3-6222593)\r\n    ✗ Android license status unknown.\r\n      Try re-installing or updating your Android SDK Manager.\r\n      See https://developer.android.com/studio/#downloads or visit https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/macos#android-setup for detailed instructions.\r\n\r\n[✓] Xcode - develop for iOS and macOS (Xcode 11.7)\r\n    • Xcode at /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer\r\n    • Xcode 11.7, Build version 11E801a\r\n    • CocoaPods version 1.9.3\r\n\r\n[✓] Chrome - develop for the web\r\n    • Chrome at /Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome\r\n\r\n[✓] Android Studio (version 4.0)\r\n    • Android Studio at /Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents\r\n    • Flutter plugin version 49.0.2\r\n    • Dart plugin version 193.7547\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_242-release-1644-b3-6222593)\r\n\r\n[✓] VS Code (version 1.49.0)\r\n    • VS Code at /Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents\r\n    • Flutter extension version 3.14.1\r\n\r\n[✓] Connected device (3 available)\r\n    • Pixel 3 (mobile) • 8BWX1G3QH  • android-arm64  • Android 11 (API 30)\r\n    • Web Server (web) • web-server • web-javascript • Flutter Tools\r\n    • Chrome (web)     • chrome     • web-javascript • Google Chrome 85.0.4183.102\r\n\r\n!
