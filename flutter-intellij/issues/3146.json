Flutter doctor reports nothing missing.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of Menu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8867023/33900638-02750cee-df24-11e7-936d-e1d160db5557.png)\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if a step is missing from the instructions, or if there's a problem with the IntelliJ plugins.\r\n\r\nI am able to run an already configured emulator from the devices pulldown.\r\n\r\n## Flutter Doctor\r\n\r\n```\r\n[✓] Flutter (on Linux, locale en_US.UTF-8, channel unknown)\r\n    • Flutter at /usr/local/google/home/gspencer/code/release/flutter\r\n    • Framework revision 8f65fec5f5 (11 minutes ago), 2017-12-12 09:50:14 -0800\r\n    • Engine revision edaecdc8b8\r\n    • Tools Dart version 1.25.0-dev.11.0\r\n    • Engine Dart version 2.0.0-edge.d8ae797298c3a6cf8dc9f4558707bd2672224d3e\r\n\r\n[✓] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK 26.0.1)\r\n    • Android SDK at /usr/local/google/home/gspencer/Android/Sdk\r\n    • Android NDK at /usr/local/google/home/gspencer/Android/Sdk/ndk-bundle\r\n    • Platform android-26, build-tools 26.0.1\r\n    • ANDROID_HOME = /usr/local/google/home/gspencer/Android/Sdk\r\n    • Java binary at: /opt/android-studio-with-blaze-2.3/jre/bin/java\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_112-release-b06)\r\n\r\n[✓] Android Studio (version 2.3)\r\n    • Android Studio at /opt/android-studio-with-blaze-2.3\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_112-release-b06)\r\n\r\n[✓] IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition (version 2017.1)\r\n    • Flutter plugin version 18.4\r\n    • Dart plugin version 171.4694.29\r\n\r\n[✓] IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition (version 2017.2)\r\n    • Flutter plugin version 20.0.2\r\n    • Dart plugin version 172.4343.25\r\n\r\n[✓] IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition (version 2017.1)\r\n    • Flutter plugin version 18.2\r\n    • Dart plugin version 171.4694.29\r\n\r\n[✓] Connected devices\r\n    • Nexus 6P • 84B7N15A07007628 • android-arm • Android 8.0.0 (API 26)\r\n```\r\n\n\n---\n\n@sethladd commented on [Tue Dec 12 2017](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/13514#issuecomment-351135802)\n\ncc @LarkAscending @mjohnsullivan \n\n---\n\n@LarkAscending commented on [Tue Dec 12 2017](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/13514#issuecomment-351143609)\n\n@sethladd  Seems like a product issue to me WDYT?\n\n---\n\n@sethladd commented on [Tue Dec 12 2017](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/13514#issuecomment-351146961)\n\nHm, good question.\r\n\r\ncc @devoncarew is there a symptom around \"AVD Manager is greyed out\" ? Does that indicate something that can be fixed by a user?\r\n\r\nAccording to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41290134/android-studio-avd-manager-button-is-disabled maybe the Android SDK is misconfigured or missing? If so, then maybe `flutter doctor` isn't doing to right thing, as it should complain here.\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/44015671/android-studio-2-3-avd-manager-greyed-out seems to hint that maybe some project files are missing?\r\n\r\nIn either case, I think the codelab doesn't need to add any explicit steps here, but we might need to make `flutter doctor` a bit smarter here to catch a potential project misconfiguration.\n\n---\n\n@rockingdice commented on [Tue Aug 21 2018](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/13514#issuecomment-414565004)\n\nFor anyone who still meets this issue on mac with Intellij idea, you can try create a new project of 'Android', it may tell you android sdk is not installed, but if you try to install it, the ide will find the sdk and nothing will change but it recognized the sdk. After that you can use AVDManager.\n\n",
