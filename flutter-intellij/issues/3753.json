I sent you a picture of this exact URL opened in a Chrome tab. Anyway, I opened it again in another tab, now I have 2 of them, both the same, equal, with the connect button. My Chrome is also updated as well. Can't you reproduce this? Don't you have any Windows 10 machines for QA? If you want I can share my screen with you.\r\n\r\nIt looks like all the development is focused on Macs, as it also looks like its the preferred choice among the Flutter team, but I hardly think the majority of Flutter developers around the world code on Macs. I honestly appreciate deeply all the work you guys do, can't stress this enough, but after the Bugs on version 37, I honestly think you guys should do a postmortem and think about improving your Windows QA before a release.\r\n\r\n> Also, if you do something in your app right now, do frames draw in the timeline view?\r\n\r\nNo.",
