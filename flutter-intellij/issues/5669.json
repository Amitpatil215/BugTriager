    "body": "Hello,\r\nI have Android Studio 4.1.2, I realised that the studio built-in emulator is available if I open certain ones of my flutter projects, but not available for new ones I created. Also the option to view the emulator from the view menu -> Tool windows -> Emulator is not there !!\r\n(In all projects, I checked from Android Studio Settings \"Launch Emulator in Tool Windows\" is checked) !!\r\n\r\nIn all cases I can run my apps on external Android Studio Emulator without problems.\r\n\r\nPlease check the attached screenshots.\r\n\r\nMy question is, for sure there is something or some setting controlling Android Studio Emulator to be available or not.\r\n![126169188-06e394c5-d5a1-4e81-933a-45cad2ee674f](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43919279/126790961-9e3ddfeb-1091-4dfd-b58b-22c70d102ceb.jpg)\r\n![126169195-9fd7849d-4068-47f8-8b4a-d61dcc2fc6ae](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43919279/126790964-ecf5981d-2646-47e7-aab1-0a100696cec0.jpg)\r\n",
