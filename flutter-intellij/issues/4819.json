To check, open Flutter Preferences/Settings and make sure the check box is ticked for `Enable code completion, navigation, etc. for Java / Kotlin`.

It depends on APIs that both Jetbrains and Android Studio frequently modify. And the Flutter team often restructures their libraries, which is another source of breakage.",
