This functionality hasn't been implemented for Dart.\r\n- Move caret to code block start/end.\r\n- Move caret forward/backward a paragraph.\r\n\r\nBut neither cares about commas.\r\n\r\nRegarding 2. If trailing comma on the current line doesn't cause a syntax error (even if nothing new is printed on the next line) then we might think about using Complete Statement (Ctrl+Shift+Enter) for this. Currently, the action only adds a line break at the end of the current line and jumps to the next line. When it brings more good than bad it might add trailing comma as well.",
