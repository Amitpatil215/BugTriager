    "body": "Another useful variation on the `wrap this new widget expression` with another new widget idiom: inserting a new expression for one of the common widget builder classes, Builder, StatefulBuilder, LayoutBuilder.\r\n\r\nThere are some idomatic scenarios where a Builder widget is needed. For example.\r\n\r\nIf you write something like the following and then try pressing the button, the `Scaffold.of(context)` expression will fail because the context doesn't actually include the Scaffold.\r\n```\r\n@override\r\nWidget build(BuildContext context) {\r\n  return new Scaffold(\r\n    ...\r\n    body: new FlatButton(\r\n      child: new Text('SHOW SNACKBAR'),\r\n      onPressed: () {\r\n        Scaffold.of(context).showSnackBar(new SnackBar(\r\n          content: ...\r\n        ));\r\n      },\r\n    ),\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWrapping the button in a builder corrects the problem because the Scaffold is within the parent of the Builder's BuildContext.\r\n```\r\n@override\r\nWidget build(BuildContext context) {\r\n  return new Scaffold(\r\n    ...\r\n    body: new Builder(\r\n      builder: (BuildContext scaffoldContext) {\r\n        return new FlatButton(\r\n          child: new Text('SHOW SNACKBAR'),\r\n          onPressed: () {\r\n            Scaffold.of(scaffoldContext).showSnackBar(new SnackBar(\r\n              content: ...\r\n            ));\r\n          },\r\n        );\r\n      },\r\n    ),\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI've called the Builder function's BuildContext parameter `scaffoldContext` for clarity. I don't think that sort of rename would be possible for the IDE to generate.\r\n\r\nIt would be really impressive if the analyzer could detect the origin `Scaffold.of(context)` and the IDE could suggest this remedy.\r\n\r\nJust FTR, the potential difficulty of referring to inherited widgets defined in the same build function is also noted here: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/4581.\r\n\r\n",
