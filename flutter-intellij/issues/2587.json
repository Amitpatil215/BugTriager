So, we default to the setter.\r\n\r\nHowever in this case, when the expression is RHS of an assignment, the user definitely means the getter. The same is for invocation arguments. Basically anywhere except of the beginning of a statement.\r\n\r\nWhich raises the question whether it is useful even for assignments. If the user is going to assign, it is useful to let him know that there is a setter. But how often users assign vs. write `x.foo.bar`? Maybe we should always use getters for consistency.\r\n\r\nFor UI we could show both green / read does for properties with both getter and setter. I guess we could use `ElementKind.FIELD` for `element` in `CompletionSuggestion`.",

You have to type `mylist.length = 5;`.\r\n\r\nLooking in the language definition (list.dart), I see the setter in list.dart is defined as `set length(int newLength);`, so I get why AutoAssist shows that.  It's just a bit of a cognitive mismatch between what it shows and what you have to type.
