If your issue is related to the Flutter framework itself,\r\nplease open an issue at\r\n[github.com/flutter/flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/new).\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n_Please tell us what you were doing and what went wrong_\r\n\r\nTrying to bind command-. (command period, e.g. as one might want to bind for Run->Stop) to an action displays \"A\" in the keyboard shortcut dialog.  Strangely it functions as command-. but also triggers on lower case \"a\"!\r\n\r\n## Version info\r\n\r\nLatest Intellij IDEA Ultimate with the Flutter plugin.  Not sure if this is really a flutter issue but this is where it sent me.\r\n\r\nPlease paste the output of running `flutter doctor -v` here (available from the command\r\nline or from `Tools > Flutter > Flutter Doctor`). It will provide the version of the\r\nFlutter framework as well as of the IntelliJ plugin.\r\n",
