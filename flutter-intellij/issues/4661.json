I should make that clearer: the Quick Docs pop-up still works (Ctrl+Q) but the palette is no longer shown on the pop-up.\r\n\r\nThe differences between a working pop-up and a non-working pop-up are the upgrades:\r\nAndroid Studio: 3.4.2 -> 4.0\r\nFlutter Plugin: 39.0.1 -> 46.0.2\r\nDart Plugin: 183.6270 -> 193.7361\r\nBoth tests used Flutter version 1.17.3.\r\n\r\nThe palette does still work in Visual Studio Code tested on Windows 10 - but not in Android Studio tested on Windows 10 and Linux Mint. Maybe the VS Code extension isn't quite as up-to-date as the Android Studio plug-in?\r\n![84604198-2fdeb380-ae8c-11ea-91b2-a14640eb89c9](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60894773/86234547-02358200-bb8f-11ea-8017-7f54b6eff78b.png)\r\n![84604195-2ead8680-ae8c-11ea-94b4-b43a2a8daad1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60894773/86234582-12e5f800-bb8f-11ea-95df-aeac8c566ead.png)\r\n![84604194-2d7c5980-ae8c-11ea-9313-4827c41f5768](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60894773/86234593-1a0d0600-bb8f-11ea-9d3f-1e6d220efce7.png)\r\n![84604191-25bcb500-ae8c-11ea-9ed1-a6a140e7e256](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60894773/86234604-1e392380-bb8f-11ea-9bd0-19921968d1a7.png)\r\n![85934464-b3f85880-b8da-11ea-9d35-b9675c19d7fd](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60894773/86234641-2abd7c00-bb8f-11ea-8989-c1d7a2bf5b7e.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nflutter doctor -v\r\n[√] Flutter (Channel stable, v1.17.4, on Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.18362.295], locale en-GB)\r\n    • Flutter version 1.17.4 at E:\\Flutter\r\n    • Framework revision 1ad9baa8b9 (2 weeks ago), 2020-06-17 14:41:16 -0700\r\n    • Engine revision ee76268252\r\n    • Dart version 2.8.4\r\n\r\n\r\n[√] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 30.0.0)\r\n    • Android SDK at D:\\Users\\John\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\sdk\r\n    • Platform android-30, build-tools 30.0.0\r\n    • Java binary at: C:\\Program Files\\Android\\Android Studio\\jre\\bin\\java\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_242-release-1644-b01)\r\n    • All Android licenses accepted.\r\n\r\n[√] Android Studio (version 4.0)\r\n    • Android Studio at C:\\Program Files\\Android\\Android Studio\r\n    • Flutter plugin version 47.0.2\r\n    • Dart plugin version 193.7361\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_242-release-1644-b01)\r\n\r\n[√] VS Code (version 1.46.1)\r\n    • VS Code at D:\\Users\\John\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Microsoft VS Code\r\n    • Flutter extension version 3.12.0\r\n\r\n[!] Connected device\r\n    !
