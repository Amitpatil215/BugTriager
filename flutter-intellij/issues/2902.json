Nice to see there some talk about this already :) \r\nOn my side the usage is a bit different from what you already talked I think. \r\nI don't really care about native manual logs (with Log.i/d/e on Android, or print/NSLOG iOS), it's nice to have but not really mandatory (for me ^^) but what's really important for me it's when I have an unexpected crash, to be able to see the stack trace easily (NPE, runtime error...) being able to toggle verbose log will allow me to see the crash directly without trying to reproduce it on Xcode/AS later (or having another windows just for native logs...) \r\n\r\nHope it help :) maybe you'll be able to detect crash and by default put it on the console, because for me it shouldn't be ignore ^^ ",
