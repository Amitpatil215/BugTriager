Get the following errors in the console (because widget_test.dart is referring to class MyApp):\r\n```\r\nerror: Undefined class 'MyApp'. (undefined_class at [testing] test/widget_test.dart:15)\r\nerror: The constructor returns type 'dynamic' that isn't of expected type 'Widget'. (strong_mode_invalid_cast_new_expr at [testing] test/widget_test.dart:15)\r\ninfo: Unused import. (unused_import at [testing] test/widget_test.dart:10)\r\n```\r\nAlso get red wavy underline under the \\<project name\\> and the `test` directory. The line in `widget_test.dart` causing the error is:\r\n```\r\nawait tester.pumpWidget(new MyApp());\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis doesn't happen after the equivalent set of steps at the command line (flutter create, replace contents of main.dart, flutter run). No errors are printed to the console in that case.\r\n\r\nNote that the app still runs; clicking the Run button on the toolbar still works. Running the app makes the console errors go away. But the red wavy underlines in the left nav persist, and it looks alarming - a new user will think they have to resolve these errors before they can run their first app.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/11304/files\r\nis where this was introduced.\r\n\r\n## Version info\r\n[✓] Flutter (on Linux, locale en_US.UTF-8, channel alpha)\r\n    • Flutter at /usr/local/google/home/eastrue/flutter\r\n    • Framework revision 1c372c6803 (8 weeks ago), 2017-08-31 15:54:45 -0700\r\n    • Engine revision f9e00a7c72\r\n    • Tools Dart version 1.25.0-dev.11.0\r\n\r\n[✓] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK 25.0.3)\r\n    • Android SDK at /usr/local/google/home/eastrue/Android/Sdk\r\n    • Platform android-25, build-tools 25.0.3\r\n    • Java binary at: /opt/android-studio-with-blaze-2.3/jre/bin/java\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_112-release-b06)\r\n\r\n[✓] Android Studio (version 2.3)\r\n    • Android Studio at /opt/android-studio-2.3\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_112-release-b06)\r\n\r\n[✓] Android Studio (version 2.3)\r\n    • Android Studio at /opt/android-studio-with-blaze-2.3\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_112-release-b06)\r\n\r\n[✓] Android Studio (version 2.2)\r\n    • Android Studio at /usr/local/google/home/eastrue/android-studio\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_76-release-b03)\r\n\r\n[-] IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition (version 2017.1)\r\n    ✗ Flutter plugin not installed; this adds Flutter specific functionality.\r\n    • Dart plugin version 171.4694.29\r\n    • For information about installing plugins, see\r\n      https://flutter.io/intellij-setup/#installing-the-plugins\r\n\r\n[✓] Connected devices\r\n    • Nexus 5X • 0048fc9b7c76b7a2 • android-arm • Android 6.0.1 (API 23)\r\n\r\n/cc @efortuna ",

The easiest might be to update the tutorial contents to modify the test in one of a few ways.\r\n\r\n1. at the outset, instruct folks to remove the test altogether or alter its contents or more ambitiously\r\n2. add instructions to update it to work with the tutorial app (e.g., modify it to reference `MaterialApp` and do something sensible\r\n\r\nThe first is easiest...",

If so, can we adjust that step, to also mention renaming the class reference in the test file, or to change the amount of code that's being copied in? I think we generally do want to generate a unit test test as part of the sample app, for pedagogical reasons, and I don't really love the idea of adding a [ ] generate unit test option to the new project wizard - I'd prefer to keep that simple and ask the user as few questions as possible.\r\n\r\n",
