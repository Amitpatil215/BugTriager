GPU profiling is not likely to yield any results since it is too low level to be accessible for app developers. We realized there were a couple of areas that we often *do the wrong thing*:\r\n\r\n- Do a lot of work in the build() fn of the widgets. Some of this work can be done only when state changes.\r\n- Call setState() too often _just in case_\r\n- Somehow cause the existing render tree to be thrown away and rebuilt. This happened initially with charts when they were creating a new object with same params (but no equals override) with every frame of the chart animation which led to a lot of jank.\r\n\r\nSome ideas:\r\n- An ability to _record_ widget tree behavior over a short period of time and analyze what happens to it:\r\n - How many times are we rebuilding?\r\n - How long is rebuild taking?\r\n - How many times does a rebuild cause re-render (invalidation of the existing render tree node)?\r\n\r\nThis information would be very useful to identify potential places where app code (as opposed to framework code) is doing something wrong.",
