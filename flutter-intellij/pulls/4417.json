    "body": "We were adding Flutter modules to the New Module Wizard of Android Studio when users wanted to use add-to-app in an Android app. We can't do that (at least for now) so this adds a \"New Flutter Module\" parallel to the \"New Flutter Project\" on the New menu.\r\n\r\nThis is derived from the New Project Wizard from 3/8/19. The Kotlin conversion had not started at that time.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/flutter/flutter-intellij/issues/4416 and https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-234445\r\n\r\nThe current version of the NPW is mostly Kotlin and we can't re-use it, due to overuse of the `final` keyword (or lack of `open` in Kotlin). And we can't compile Kotlin in our build process, so I couldn't copy the current version.\r\n\r\nAfter coverage analysis proved nearly all of it was unused I remove about 95% of the NPW classes. Those remaining are in the package with suffix `npwOld` and can be ignored.",
