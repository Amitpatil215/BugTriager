This could break, and our fallback is to simply stop using those methods. That would make the wizard look like it does in IntelliJ. There should be no changes to the IntelliJ wizard, although almost all the code is shared.\r\n\r\nAndroid Studio has always highlighted the help message for the selected project type, so I found a way to do that here, too. \r\n\r\nFlutterNewProjectAction.java_stub is the previous version of `FlutterNewProjectAction`, which is required for AS 4.1 (see the change in product-matrix.json).\r\n\r\nFYI @devoncarew @pq",
