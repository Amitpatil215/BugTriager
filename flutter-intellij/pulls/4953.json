Class files built by Java 11 that specify Java 8 compatibility still have class file version 55 so the plugin can't be used in Android Studio 4.0 and 4.1. That might be a bug in the IntelliJ plugin for Gradle.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of changes here:\r\n- Add Java version to Gradle script, set it in the plugin tool based on build version\r\n- Unroll the build loop to do a single build at a time, manually incrementing the minor version number\r\n- Change the Java version halfway through\r\n- Refactor two utility functions (devBuildNumber(), _nextRelease()) into util.dart\r\n- Move build version constructor from a switch branch to buildVersionNumber() in util.dart\r\n- Use buildVersionNumber() everywhere that needs to use that value\r\n- Move ++pluginCount into the main loop\r\n",
