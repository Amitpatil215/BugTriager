    "body": "Fixes #5313 \r\n\r\nWe used to use `DartPlugin.isDartSdkEnabled(module)` as a quick short-circuit for checking if the Flutter SDK was configured. That isn't reliable (not sure why) anymore. The result is that the first time a project is created after IntelliJ is launched, the project does not have its SDK configured. Projects created after the first one do, however.\r\n\r\nThis also adds support for the new `.dart_tool/package_config.json` file.\r\n\r\nSince the Dart SDK is configured, I tried to find a way to determine its location on disk. You can see in External Libraries that it knows about its content, so the path has to be somewhere. The IntelliJ API does not appear to reveal that information.\r\n\r\n@alexander-doroshko If you can take a minute to look at this I'd appreciate any tips on finding the Dart SDK on disk. This approach works, and seems fast enough, but I can't help thinking it is redundant.",
