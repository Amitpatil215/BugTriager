The case of the stack trace wasn't immediately clear (in fact, nothing in that stack trace should have been null). This PR adds some NotNull annotations to clarify some if the intent of the variables.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\tat com.intellij.openapi.util.Disposer.dispose(Disposer.java:120)\r\n\tat io.flutter.perf.FlutterWidgetPerf.dispose(FlutterWidgetPerf.java:461)\r\n\tat io.flutter.perf.FlutterWidgetPerfManager.updateCurrentAppChanged(FlutterWidgetPerfManager.java:276)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen in here, I also addressed an old TODO in terms of unregistering an event listener. As well, I updated to the latest version of the VM service protocol lib (upstreaming a change we'd made to the generated code (https://dart-review.googlesource.com/c/sdk/+/204260).\r\n\r\nThe library upgrade was done in two commits in order to make the review a little easier.",
