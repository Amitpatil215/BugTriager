It is much faster. Also, instead of running `flutter channel` this runs the git command directly.\r\n\r\nWe need to add unit tests to `flutter_tools` that document which fields we depend on from the settings file. We should also have a test that warns `flutter_tools` authors that if the locations of the settings file changes that IDE authors need to be notified.\r\n\r\nThe check boxes still need to be added to the wizard used by AS 4.1. That is a separate project, which may resolve itself when 4.2 becomes stable.\r\n\r\nLine 26 of CONTRIBUTING.md documents the additional dependency on git4idea.",
