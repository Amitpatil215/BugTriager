    "body": "@jwren \r\n\r\nThe `flutter-intellij-community.iml` file is needed to work on the plugin with Android Studio sources.\r\n\r\nThe studio-specific source trees for `io.flutter.project` and `io.flutter.module` were obsolete. They had to be deleted due to API changes.\r\n\r\nThe versions all build correctly. The canary version does not work because of a class-not-found error (but it does work in the debugger). The class (`org.jetbrains.idea.maven.wizards.MavenWizardBundle`) is defined in the `flutter-studio` module but it is not found by the Jetbrains-specific NPW code. I'm not sure how to fix that yet; it looks like we'd need to insert something onto the classpath of a module that we don't control. Maybe @alexander-doroshko has some suggestion how to do that? As far as I can tell, the missing class is distributed with IntelliJ but not Android Studio. Normally, Android Studio would not need it. It is used by the IntelliJ NPW framework that the Flutter plugin uses for project creation.",
