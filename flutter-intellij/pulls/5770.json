It also adds a new setting that will allow files ending with `_test.dart` to be treated as test files if they are in a directory marked as Sources Root, such as `lib`. The new setting is opt-in.\r\n\r\nI noticed that many settings were not included in the searchable options, so I added them. I also made some consistency changes, and moved all the embedded strings to the bundle properties file.",
