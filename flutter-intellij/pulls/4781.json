(Pub root and pubspec files remain cached.) Caching `VirtualFiles` that are within project content usually doesn't help to improve performance. Everything is already cached in the VFS, and methods like `getParent()` or `findChild()` normally take no time. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, manual caching of `VirtualFiles` adds a huge headache with updating or clearing cache as needed. As far as I can see, cache updating and clearing is not implemented.\r\n\r\nWhat definitely needs to be cached is information based on `pubspec` content. We don't want to parse pubspec again and again if its content hasn't changed. This cache is implemented in `validateUpdateCachedPubspecInfo()` and neighbor methods. This logic definitely needs to remain. The rest of caching (`PubRoot`, `PubRootCache`) probably doesn't add any performance boost but adds bugs and maintenance headache.",
