    "body": "Prior to this PR, icon preview analysis was performed as a batch operation, which could stall the EDT. This was not a common problem as it ran fast enough when there were only one or two icon packages to analyze. This change converts it to an incremental background process that automatically restarts when a read action gets terminated.\r\n\r\nThe code analysis hasn't changed, but the order in which operations occur has, in some cases. For example, the field `filesWithNoClasses` is used as the inverse of examining the count of classes in a file. The main difference is the addition of a lot of thread management code.",
