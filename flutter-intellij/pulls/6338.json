Initially, this will only be enabled on JavaScript repositories, but we plan to add more languages to this soon. The new feature can be disabled by passing the <code>trap-caching: false</code> option to your workflow's <code>init</code> step, for example if you are already using the GitHub Actions cache for a different purpose and are near the storage limit for it.</li>\n<li>Add support for Python automatic dependency installation with Poetry 1.2 <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1258\">#1258</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.24 - 16 Sep 2022</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.1.23 - 14 Sep 2022</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Allow CodeQL packs to be downloaded from GitHub Enterprise Server instances, using the new <code>registries</code> input for the <code>init</code> action.  <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1221\">#1221</a></li>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.10.5. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1240\">#1240</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.22 - 01 Sep 2022</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Downloading CodeQL packs has been moved to the <code>init</code> step. Previously, CodeQL packs were downloaded during the <code>analyze</code> step. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1218\">#1218</a></li>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.10.4. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1224\">#1224</a></li>\n<li>The newly released <a href=\"https://python-poetry.org/blog/announcing-poetry-1.2.0\">Poetry 1.2</a> is not yet supported. In the most common case where the CodeQL Action is automatically installing Python dependencies, it will continue to install and use Poetry 1.1 on its own. However, in certain cases such as with self-hosted runners, you may need to ensure Poetry 1.1 is installed yourself.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.21 - 25 Aug 2022</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve error messages when the code scanning configuration file includes an invalid <code>queries</code> block or an invalid <code>query-filters</code> block. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1208\">#1208</a></li>\n<li>Fix a bug where Go build tracing could fail on Windows. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1209\">#1209</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.20 - 22 Aug 2022</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.1.19 - 17 Aug 2022</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add the ability to filter queries from a code scanning run by using the <code>query-filters</code> option in the code scanning configuration file. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1098\">#1098</a></li>\n<li>In debug mode, debug artifacts are now uploaded even if a step in the Actions workflow fails. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1159\">#1159</a></li>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.10.3. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1178\">#1178</a></li>\n<li>The combination of python2 and Pipenv is no longer supported. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1181\">#1181</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.18 - 03 Aug 2022</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.10.2.  <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1156\">#1156</a></li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
