The changes need to be made to both *.iml files, but I only did one.\r\n\r\nI don't plan to commit this PR. It's just to get @helin24 going. The required binaries are not part of this PR.\r\n\r\nAlso, the build script still needs to be updated to pull in the jar files when the plugin is built for distribution. I'll do that later.\r\n\r\n@jacob314 @devoncarew ",
