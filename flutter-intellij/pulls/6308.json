Several other bugs and changes were included to streamline and speed up the build process as well.  Additionally, a new  target, 'artifacts' has been added to aid in identifying needed downloads. \r\n\r\nSummary of changes\r\n- 'unpack' cli arg is moved up used in Setup and Build commands to determine if artifacts should be unpacked again.\r\n- Artifacts are now unpacked to version tagged directories. This cuts down on disk I/O on repeated or bulk builds and should speed up the process.\r\n- Artifacts are unpacked using `dart:archive` package instead of relying on local `tar` and `zip` commands.\r\n- `gradle.properties` updated to provide IDEA version to builds and also fix a bug with the `name` property used for determining the plugin name.\r\n- Housekeeping: more comments, renamed variables, Green text for separators and red text for errors in log output.\r\n- `plugin.bat` file created for invocation on Windows platforms.\r\n- More specific changes/info can be found in commit message history.\r\n- \r\nAddresses: https://github.com/flutter/flutter-intellij/issues/6052\r\n\r\n## Pre-launch Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I read the [Contributor Guide] and followed the process outlined there for submitting PRs.\r\n- [x] I read the [Tree Hygiene] wiki page, which explains my responsibilities.\r\n- [x] I read the [Flutter Style Guide] _recently_, and have followed its advice.\r\n- [x] I signed the [CLA].\r\n- [x] I listed at least one issue that this PR fixes in the description above.\r\n- [x] I updated/added relevant documentation (doc comments with `///`).\r\n- [x] I added new tests to check the change I am making, or this PR is [test-exempt].\r\n- [x] All existing and new tests are passing.\r\n\r\n<!-- Links -->\r\n[Contributor Guide]: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Tree-hygiene#overview\r\n[Tree Hygiene]: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Tree-hygiene\r\n[test-exempt]: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Tree-hygiene#tests\r\n[Flutter Style Guide]: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Style-guide-for-Flutter-repo\r\n[CLA]: https://cla.developers.google.com/\r\n[flutter/tests]: https://github.com/flutter/tests\r\n[breaking change policy]: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Tree-hygiene#handling-breaking-changes\r\n[Discord]: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Chat\r\n",

Previously, each subsequent build would have to delete and re-write the `android-studio`, `Dart`, and `idea` directories. Instead, we now unpack to version labeled sub-directories and only re-create if forced (-`u`, `rebuildCache`) or if the directory is older than the zip/tar package.  So I _think_ this can stay 'as is'.

                "message": "Refactor of `tool/plugin` to support multiple platforms.\n\n`artifact.dart`\n  - Use `path.join` to safely create file/folder paths.\n - 'artifacts' as a directory location is sometimes referenced with and without a root path, this could lead to inconsistencies with identifying already downloaded files or unpacking existing files. Prefixing a 'rootPath' to Artifact and ArtifactManager references.\n\n  Refactored `Artifact`:\n   - 'bareArchive' no longer required, all artifacts are unpacked to matching structures.\n   - Added `ideaVersion` to list of fields\n   - All fields are final\n   - `exists` is now async, `existsSync` for sync checks.\n   - `filePath` getter uses platform safe paths and returns full path to artifact file.\n\n  Refactored `ArtifactManager`:\n   - Simplified `provision` behavior.\n   - Use `archive` library to handle unpacking artifacts instead of cmd calls to `tar` and `zip`\n\n`build_spec.dart`\n - Inlined 'createArtifacts' since it's only ever called from the named constructor and really shouldn't be accessible from anywhere else.\n - Provide better logic for determining artifact file names based on current/targeted platform/version, etc.\n - Fix 'toString' method to report actual version info. Kept release jic.\n\n`edit.dart`\n - Ensure correct artifact folder names using ide + version\n\n`plugin.dart`\n - Use agnostic calls to Gradle wrapper.\n - Add `platform` command line arg, defaults to detected platform except for Mac ARM, not yet supported by Dart:io\n - `unpack` command line arg moved up. All dependent build methods should now use it correctly. This changes some of the previous 'rebuildCache' behavior, but with the new artifact identifcation logic, it shouldn't cause problems.\n\n`runner.dart`\n - Use path.join to safely create file/folder paths.\n - Change `name` to `ideaPluginName`. This fixes a hidden bug: The `name` property is set by Gradle based on the project folder and isn't overidden by the `gradle.properties` file. This causes errors if the project is cloned to a folder other than `flutter-intellij`.\n - `ideaVersion` added to `gradle.properties` to support identifying correct libraries for compilation.\n\n`util.dart`\n - Refactor 'removeAll' and replace system calls with async library calls.\n - Add 'archive' package and create specific methods for extracting tar and zip files to replace old system calls.\n - `curl` now follows redirects.\n - Added `execLocalGradleCommand` for making platform dependent gradle wrapper calls\n - Add 'asError' param to 'log' method. Formats message with ansi.red.\n - Change separator to output green text, leave red for errors.\n\n`flutter-idea/build.gradle.kts`\n - Change resources root in gradle to use project.rootDir, side-stepping the need for a 'symlink' file in the build process.\n\n`AUTHORS`\n - Add myself to Authors list.\n\n`plugin.bat`\n - Add bat version of plugin tool for windows platforms.\n\nOther general housekeeping, code cleanup, reformatting, etc...",

Remove 2nd call to argResults['only-version'] to avoid errors.\n  - Remove directory checks in `applyEdits` since we only apply edits to files.",
