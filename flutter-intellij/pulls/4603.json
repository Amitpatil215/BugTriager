This change skips notifying subscribers if disconnected.\r\n\r\nI tested this by keeping a project open during prodaccess loss and regain and verifying with breakpoints that refresh occurs in `WorkspaceCache`.\r\n\r\nNote that there are still some issues with this change.\r\n- IntelliJ detecting `rootsChanged` is slow on disconnect and reconnect, often takes a few minutes to trigger\r\n- `ProjectWatch` seems to fail if IntelliJ experiences a 'Unable to save settings' error, which I have not been able to reproduce consistently (see below for more details)",
