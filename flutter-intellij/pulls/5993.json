I added a fall-back option to the one place that hadn't. I expect the Dart plugin will be updated soon, and when it is this fall-back option can be removed.\r\n\r\nWe are not deleting the code that uses `.packages` yet because old projects could, possibly, not have the package config file. That seems unlikely, but at some point it should be safe to trim all references to `.packages`.\r\n\r\nFixes #5614 \r\n",
