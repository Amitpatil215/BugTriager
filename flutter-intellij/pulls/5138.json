Alternatives:\r\n- add a separate script (like `runScript`) to manage any port setup and call this after the server starts (more divergence between bazel and regular flutter tools, too many scripts?)\r\n- wait for DevTools to finish (app running could be slower, would have to move to a pooled thread)",
