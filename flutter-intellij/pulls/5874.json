In DevTools, we will show a warning to users to stop launching from pub if they are on Flutter 2.8.0 or Dart 2.15 or greater. The reasoning behind this is we didn't want to downgrade users by telling them to stop launching from pub. My concern with using Flutter 2.6.0-12.0.pre.854 is that we may downgrade a user's devtools version by doing this. Maybe we should gate instead on flutter 2.8.0, which we know has DevTools 2.8.0 included.",
