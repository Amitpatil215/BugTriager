Android Studio logs showed that AS didn't receive the \"device.enable\" command response. Just putting some breakpoints were solving the issue, identifying a race condition (sending the command too early).\r\n\r\nThe fix waits for the \"daemon.connected\" before sending any commands.\r\n\r\n## Test\r\n\r\nI was not able to correctly build the plugin. The version I built showed the fix is working, but other stuff were broken. It may be caused by me using the \"master\" version of the plugin in AS 3.5.1, or by bad project/dependencies configuration.",
