It also removes editing support for AS 3.6.\r\n\r\nThe `plugin make` command has been failing after the fourth invocation of the `:instrumentCode` task in a single daemon:\r\n> Forms instrumentation failed for .../io/flutter/project/FlutterProjectStep.form: : FlutterProjectStep.form: ZipFile invalid LOC header (bad signature)\r\n\r\nThis wasn't a problem with Gradle 4 but began failing with 5.6.1 and 6.6.1. JetBrains has deprecated forms, so this work-around seems like the best fix. Longer term, we should rewrite all the forms using the [Kotlin UI DSL](https://jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/user_interface_components/kotlin_ui_dsl.html).\r\n\r\nI've had three consecutive successful builds with this change, and I hope it makes the dev channel buildable again.",
